COMDEX Updated Build Plan (STICKEY)
1. Branding and Naming:
Brand Name: "STICKEY"

Stable Coin: "$GLU"

Display "$GLU" prominently across the platform.

2. Frontend/UI Design Changes:
Landing Page (Main Entry Point):

STICKEY Branding: Replace the existing logo and branding with "STICKEY" and "$GLU".

Currency Swap:

Centralize the swap feature for currency conversion.

Users can swap from GBP to $GLU and other relevant currencies.

Display the exchange rate and update it in real-time.

Search Bar:

Prominently visible for searching commodities.

Initially, a dropdown for available products like Whey Protein, Cocoa, etc.

As the platform grows, this will evolve into a broader search system with categories and filters.

Scrolling Exchange Rates:

Add a scrolling bar at the bottom showing real-time prices of commodities in $GLU, USD, and local currencies.

Allow users to track changes in commodity prices, helping in making purchasing decisions.

UI Design:

Clean, modern design using blue tones consistent with the STICKEY branding.

Intuitive UI, with clearly defined buttons, product tiles, and call-to-action sections.

Product Search Results Page:

Product List:

Display results such as "Whey Protein", "Cocoa", etc., with key information:

Supplier Name

Product Origin

Cost per KG (in $GLU and USD)

Product Specifications

Ratings/Stars

Include the ability to filter and sort by supplier, price, ratings, etc.

Pagination for long product lists (e.g., "1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5").

Product Buttons:

Display buttons for each product at the bottom, showcasing price and allowing users to view more details or add the product to their quote.

Product Page:

Product Details:

Supplier information, product specifications, and certifications.

Show the product‚Äôs available quantity, lead time, and export details (origin country, packaging).

Add a section for "Contract Terms", where buyers can review product terms, pricing, and MOQ.

Include images and videos of the product.

Media:

Support for videos and images showing the product, production process, or product usage (like an Amazon product page).

Generate Quote:

A "Generate Quote" button that creates a draft contract and triggers the contract creation process.

Shipping Options:

Allow users to view shipping quotes from various providers like DHL, UPS, etc. Include cost estimations for each shipping method.

Buyer and Supplier Dashboards:

Payment terms, including the escrow amount.

Shipping details, including options to select and pay for shipping providers.

Timeline and expected delivery.

Blockchain contract address and status.

Escrow: Payment will be locked in escrow until the shipping provider confirms collection.

QR Code for Collection: Once the shipment is collected, the shipping provider scans the QR code to release escrow funds.

Each contract should be recorded on the blockchain, accessible for both parties.

An NFT will be generated for each contract as a certificate of authenticity.

4. User Interaction and Smart Contracts:
Notifications:

Alert users about contract status, price changes, expiring offers, and updates in real-time.

Notifications should be visible in both the buyer and supplier dashboards.

Quote/Contract Timeline:

The contract's price should update over time based on market rates, and users should be notified of these updates.

The system should ensure that both parties are aware of the changing prices until the contract is locked in.
