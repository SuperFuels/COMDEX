# 🧾 COMDEX Project Summary (Updated — 2025-04-22)

## 🌍 Overview

COMDEX is a next-gen global commodity trading platform built for trust, automation, and transparency — combining AI, blockchain, and crypto-native features to reshape how global B2B trade happens.

---

## 🔹 Business Plan

### 🎯 Mission
Revolutionize global commodity trade with on-chain transparency, autonomous trade agents, and AI-powered deal intelligence.

### ❗ Problems Solved
- Manual, fragmented global commodity trade
- Trust and quality verification issues
- Global payment friction and reconciliation delays
- Supply chain traceability challenges
- No unified B2B trade network with crypto-native design

### 🎯 Target Market
- V1: Whey protein (EU, USA, India, NZ)
- V2+: Cocoa, coffee, olive oil, pea protein, spices

### 💰 Revenue Model
- 2–3% transaction fee on deals
- Premium supplier subscriptions
- Supply chain passport licensing
- FX/Crypto swap fee margins
- Smart contract escrow fees
- NFT verification certificate minting

---

## ✅ Version 1 — MVP (Shipped)

### ✅ Core Features
- Supplier onboarding (KYC placeholder)
- JWT-based authentication (register/login)
- Buyer/supplier role-based dashboards
- Product listing (title, price, origin, image, description)
- Image upload (stored locally)

---

## 🧱 Database Schema (as of 2025-04-22)

### 📦 users
- id, name, email, password_hash
- role (admin/supplier/buyer)
- wallet_address (nullable)
- created_at, updated_at

### 📦 products
- id, owner_email (FK)
- title, description, price_per_kg
- origin_country, category, image_url
- batch_number, trace_id, certificate_url, blockchain_tx_hash
- created_at

### 📦 deals
- id, buyer_id, supplier_id, product_id
- quantity_kg, agreed_price, currency
- status: negotiation → confirmed → completed
- created_at, pdf_url

---

## 🔁 COMDEX V2+ Roadmap — Next Steps (Priority Ordered)

### ✅ Phase 1: Wallet Connection (Complete)
- Connect MetaMask via `window.ethereum`
- Display wallet address on homepage

---

### 🔧 Phase 2: Wallet Identity Binding (Now)
**Goal**: Wallet = persistent login identity + dashboard access

#### 🔥 Backend
- Add `wallet_address` to `User` model (nullable)
- Create `PATCH /users/me/wallet` endpoint (JWT required)

#### 🔥 Frontend
- After MetaMask connect → call backend to store address

> Prepares for:
> - `POST /auth/wallet` signed login (Phase 3)
> - Tying deals, NFTs, and smart contracts to wallet identity

---

### 🧭 Phase 3: Buyer/Seller Onboarding UI Cleanup
**Goal**: Improve role-based UX

- Improve `register.tsx` with clean radio buttons or dropdown
- Add icons/descriptions for Buyer vs Supplier
- Customize dashboards visually for each role

---

### 🧾 Phase 4: Product Passport Schema
**Goal**: Enable traceability, COA certs, NFT/QR verification

- Extend Product model:
  ```ts
  batch_number?: string;
  trace_id?: string;
  certificate_url?: string;
  blockchain_tx_hash?: string;

Future GET /products/:id/passport API

Add QR link to explorer / NFT cert view

🤖 Phase 5: AI Matching Engine (Planning)
Goal: Suggest ideal supplier matches to buyers

POST /match with criteria (volume, location, category, price)

Stub response: ranked supplier list

UI mock: "Find Matches" → card display

🔄 Phase 6: Swap Engine UI Logic
Goal: Simulate token conversion interface

Input: Token A / Token B (estimate)

Dropdown: Choose between crypto or fiat

Placeholder logic for now (no on-chain routing)

⚡ Bonus Features (Strategic Additions)

Feature	Why It Matters
Signed Wallet Auth (V3)	Login directly via MetaMask
On-Chain Profile NFTs	User passport as NFT
Marketplace Messaging	Direct buyer ↔ supplier communication
Gas Fee Estimator	Transparency before sending transactions
Smart Contract Escrow	Trustless deal locking w/ stablecoin
💸 COMDEX Coin Model (V2/V3)
🪙 1. COMDEX Stablecoin
Used for on-chain escrow (COMDEX contracts)

Fiat-pegged, deal-specific minting

🔁 2. FX Swap Engine
Fiat ↔ crypto swapping UX (Uniswap-style)

Supports USD, EUR, INR, BTC, ETH, etc.

🚀 3. CDXT Investor Token ("Shitcoin")
Utility + speculation + reward mechanics

🏦 4. CVAL Store-of-Value Coin
BTC-like deflationary reserve asset

🔗 Blockchain Roadmap
Fork Polygon (EVM-compatible L1)

Build COMDEX Chain:

On-chain commodity smart contracts

NFT-based product certificates (COA)

QR-encoded product explorer view

WalletConnect + MetaMask support

🤖 AI Agents Roadmap (V2/V3)
Role-based AI agents for buyers/sellers

Agent-to-agent negotiation protocol

Market alerts & AI price prediction
