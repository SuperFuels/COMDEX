# COMDEX Project Summary (Updated - 2025-04-19)

## Overview

**COMDEX** is a modern global commodity marketplace, starting with **whey protein**, where **verified suppliers** can list products and **buyers** can transact using **fiat (via Stripe)** or—eventually—**cryptocurrency**. The platform emphasizes transparency, traceability, and frictionless transactions, with a clean design and AI-driven tools planned for future phases.
