COMDEX Project Summary (Updated - 2025-04-16)
Progress Updates:
Switched from Alembic to manual SQLAlchemy table creation.

Created tables for users and deals using SQLAlchemy (via create_tables.py).

Resolved import errors and corrected path issues within models.py and __init__.

Tables (users and deals) successfully created in the PostgreSQL database.

The admin panel is now showing at [http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard].

Next Steps for Tomorrow:
Fully test table creation and database connection.

Test admin panel functionality and its integration with the database.

Continue with the integration of other features such as product listings, deals, and payment flows.
