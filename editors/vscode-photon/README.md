# Photon Language (basic)

Minimal highlighting for `.photon` / `.pthon`:
- Glyph keywords (`⧁`, `⥁`, `⤴`, …)
- Operators (`≔`, `⟶`, `⩴`, `≟≟`, …)
- Core ops as call heads (`⊕`, `μ`, `↔`, `⟲`, `π`)

## Install (VS Code)
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. `F5` to launch an Extension Development Host.
3. Open a `.photon` file and confirm highlighting.
