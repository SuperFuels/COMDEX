Public-facing language: Autonomous Coherence Optimization / Lyapunov-Regulated Directedness.
No “sentience/intent” claims in Wave-1.

## Wave 1 backbone order (draft)
1) Symatics (axioms / rewrite laws)
2) Photon Algebra (SRK-12) + Photon/Binary bridge
3) Information metric / measurement consistency (PAEV-A3 if present)
4) CodexCore + VirtualCPU (determinism + trace)
5) GlyphOS (wire format) + Benchmark (compression/runtime)
6) SQI/SQM release (telemetry + audit artifacts)
7) Tessaris synthesis (only after above are sealed)
