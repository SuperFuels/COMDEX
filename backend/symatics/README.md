# Symatics (v0.1)

Post-numeric algebra over wave/glyph primitives. Units are **signatures**, not numbers.
Operators are physical/symbolic: superposition (⊕), entanglement (↔), resonance (⟲), measurement (μ), projection (π),
fold (𝔽), expand (𝔼), transport (τ), interference (⊖).

This module provides:
- Formal axioms (machine-checkable rewrite laws)
- Typed term language + evaluator
- Wave signatures + invariants
- Measurement-as-canonicalization for “units”
