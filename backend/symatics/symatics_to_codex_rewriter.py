"""
Symatics → CodexLang Rewriter
─────────────────────────────
Transforms symbolic "Symatics" ops (experimental operators and glyphs) 
into canonical CodexLang equivalents.

- This module acts as the bridge layer between Symatics expressions 
  and Codex symbolic execution.
- Keeps the shape of instruction trees consistent with CodexLang 
  (dicts with "op" and "args").
- Lightweight and deterministic, safe to monkeypatch in tests.
