# AION SD-Only Execution Plan

Status: LOCKED for execution until faster storage or additional hardware is available.

Baseline date: 6 September 2026  
Baseline implementation: `0138c2bf`  
Evidence root: `/Volumes/Install macOS Sonoma/AION-Inference`

## Objective

Make the Glyph-Addressed Adaptive Inference Runtime as correct, responsive,
memory-efficient and useful as possible on the current Mac and SD card. The
programme must determine how far commodity removable storage can extend local
AI before any NVMe or other hardware is introduced.

The commercial optimization target is not raw accelerator throughput. It is:

> Lowest hardware cost per successfully completed private task.

## Locked baseline

- Model: IBM Granite 3.1 MoE 3B Instruct, FP16 Transformers control.
- Architecture: 32 MoE layers, 40 experts per layer, 8 selected per token.
- External expert library: 1,280 content-addressed SD-backed experts.
- Current cache reference: corpus-trained bounded-frequency controller.
- Current longer-generation median: 24 tokens in 123.689 seconds.
- Current throughput: approximately 0.194 tokens per second.
- Previous controller: approximately 0.179 tokens per second.
- Fully resident same-model control: approximately 9.3 tokens per second.
- Current exactness: every tested token ID and generation-step logit matches.
- Automatic planner: explicit 1, 2 and 3 GiB expert-cache ceilings.
- Current byte-ceiling replay result: 2.24--3.87% lower held-out logical demand
  than equal per-layer allocation, with nine of nine fold/budget wins.

The baseline artifacts and hashes must never be overwritten. Failed or
invalidated results remain preserved with explicit sidecars.

## Non-negotiable integrity gates

No optimization may be promoted unless all applicable gates pass:

1. Every generated token ID equals the unrestricted control.
2. Every generation-step logit tensor equals the unrestricted control exactly.
3. Model, shard, pack, cache-plan and evidence hashes verify.
4. The declared resident-memory ceiling is never exceeded by the controller.
5. Every requested condition and condition order completes.
6. Timings report prompt count, generated tokens, p50 and p95, not only a best run.
7. Cold and warm storage conditions are reported separately.
8. Aggregate improvements include per-prompt regressions and worst cases.
9. A failed gate invalidates promotion but does not delete the experiment.
10. No result from route replay is described as a live latency or memory result.

## Scope while hardware is unchanged

Permitted:

- Current Mac, current SD card and models already present on the evidence volume.
- Changes to the AION inference package, focused tests and SD-backed evidence.
- Qwen 3 1.7B and Granite 3.1 MoE 3B as the initial two-model library.
- Long-running experiments when bounded, recoverable and evidence-producing.

Deferred until new hardware:

- Purchasing or recommending a final production storage configuration.
- Downloading a larger checkpoint merely to claim a larger parameter count.
- SD-versus-NVMe performance conclusions.
- Claims of production concurrency, NVIDIA-equivalent throughput or datacenter
  replacement.

## Execution stages

### Stage 1 - Locate the real bottleneck

Instrument every expert activation and generation step to separate:

- storage wait time;
- bytes requested and bytes returned;
- operating-system cache effects;
- Safetensors/index decoding;
- host-to-Metal tensor transfer;
- synchronization time;
- expert compute time; and
- cache lookup, eviction and planner overhead.

Add bounded cold/warm modes and record enough information to reconcile totals.
The output is a content-addressed bottleneck report, not an inferred diagnosis.

Exit gate: at least 95% of measured wall time is assigned to named stages, or
the report explicitly records the unassigned remainder.

### Stage 2 - Remove avoidable SD work

Evaluate, one change at a time:

- persistent verified handles for per-layer packs;
- memory-mapped or ranged access where compatible with exact tensor loading;
- coalesced reads for experts selected together;
- batched Metal transfer;
- fewer synchronization boundaries;
- immediate eviction of demonstrably low-value experts; and
- byte-ceiling allocations at 1, 2 and 3 GiB.

Each optimization receives an ABBA comparison with identical prompts and an
exact miss path. File-open reductions alone are not treated as success because
that hypothesis has already been falsified as the dominant bottleneck.

Promotion gate: at least 10% median live-time improvement, lower or equal
logical demand, no material p95 regression, and complete exactness.

### Stage 3 - Predict narrowly and overlap safely

Build per-layer transition statistics from prompt-private routes. Predict the
next token's likely experts from recent routes and begin loading only when
confidence and unused memory headroom justify it.

The predictor must:

- operate separately for every layer;
- remain inside the selected byte ceiling;
- load at most one or two layers ahead;
- cancel or discard stale predictions;
- record useful and wasted prefetch bytes separately; and
- fall through to the exact demand loader on every miss.

Broad family-wide prefetch remains rejected.

Promotion gate: useful prefetch exceeds wasted prefetch, demand stalls fall,
median and p95 improve, and exact tokens/logits remain unchanged.

### Stage 4 - Storage-first boot

Replace the temporary full-checkpoint startup with a model construction path
that does not first place all experts in Metal memory. Load shared tensors and
router components normally, bind expert placeholders to verified SD pack
addresses, and materialize an expert only through the governed cache.

Exit gates:

- startup peak is materially below full-model residency;
- all 1,280 experts remain addressable;
- corrupt, absent or substituted expert objects fail closed;
- first inference and subsequent inference pass exactness; and
- interrupted startup leaves no promoted partial state.

### Stage 5 - Long and randomized validation

Use multiple prompt families and 64, 128 and 256 generated-token targets.
Randomize or balance ABBA/BAAB order across separate runs. Report:

- tokens per second and time to first token;
- p50 and p95 latency;
- expert faults, retained hits and useful prefetch;
- logical and observable physical reads;
- peak Metal and process memory;
- temperature or throttling indicators available without privileged tools;
- failures, retries and exactness; and
- sensitivity to 1, 2 and 3 GiB cache ceilings.

Milestones are deliberately staged:

- first useful target: at least 0.30 tokens per second;
- strong SD result: at least 0.50 tokens per second;
- stretch result: at least 1.00 token per second.

These are engineering targets, not claims. If the bottleneck evidence shows the
SD medium cannot reach them, the result is a valid hardware-bound falsification.

### Stage 6 - Existing two-model routing

Use the models already present. The Semantic Gateway selects in this order:

1. verified replay;
2. promoted AtomSheet or bounded workflow;
3. Qwen 3 1.7B for an eligible low-cost language task;
4. Granite MoE storage-backed reasoning when its capability is required; and
5. safe refusal or explicit unsupported result.

Record route choice, reason, estimated cost, actual latency, correctness and
fallbacks. The router must never select a smaller model solely to improve a
speed metric when its quality gate fails.

Exit gate: the two-model system improves completed-task latency or resource use
on a blinded task set without reducing the accepted-task success rate.

### Stage 7 - Small-business usefulness and economics

Build a representative private workload spanning calculations, quotations,
policy checks, document extraction, short drafting, planning and coding. Measure
the complete task, not merely model generation.

Report:

- successful tasks per hour;
- median and p95 user-perceived latency;
- percentage served by replay, AtomSheets, Qwen and Granite;
- model calls and model tokens avoided;
- peak memory and storage traffic;
- operator-review or approval requirements; and
- hardware cost per successful private task using the already-owned host as a
  separately declared assumption.

This is the primary commercial metric for the SD prototype.

## Stop and pivot rules

Stop optimizing a strategy when any of the following is demonstrated twice in
controlled evidence:

- it changes a token or logit;
- it moves rather than removes I/O and provides no latency benefit;
- it improves the median but causes an unacceptable p95 or family regression;
- it depends primarily on uncontrolled filesystem warming;
- it crosses the declared memory ceiling;
- it adds more speculative prefetch bytes than useful bytes; or
- its complexity is disproportionate to the measured gain.

On a stop, preserve the result, document the falsified hypothesis and advance
to the next bounded strategy.

## Hardware handoff package

Before attaching NVMe, freeze:

- the best SD implementation commit;
- exact model and artifact hashes;
- the full SD cold/warm benchmark corpus;
- 1, 2 and 3 GiB cache plans;
- storage-first startup measurements;
- two-model routing results;
- the business-task economics report; and
- a single reproducible command for the storage-medium comparison.

The same package will then run unchanged against USB SSD, 10 Gbps USB NVMe,
USB4/Thunderbolt NVMe, internal PCIe NVMe where available, and full-memory
execution. This prevents later hardware improvements from being confused with
software or workload changes.

## Current next action

Implement Stage 1 timing and read-accounting instrumentation, run it against
the current 24-token corpus, and choose the next optimization solely from the
largest measured wall-time component.
