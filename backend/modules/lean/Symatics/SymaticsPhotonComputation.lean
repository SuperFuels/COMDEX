Symatics Photon Computation (A14–A16)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Extends the Symatics Algebra into the discrete photon domain.
Defines the interaction rules between photons, waves, and phase
manifolds — formalizing symbolic computation as quantized light.

-- === A14. Photon–Wave Interaction ===
/--
Photons mediate transitions between phase states of waves,
representing quantized packets of resonance information.
-/
constant interact : Photon → Wave → Wave
notation "Φ(" p "," ψ ")" => interact p ψ

axiom A14_photon_wave_interaction :
  ∀ (p : Photon) (ψ : Wave),
    ∃ ψ' : Wave, Φ(p, ψ) = superpose ψ ψ'

axiom A14_energy_transfer :
  ∀ (p : Photon) (φ : Phase),
    Energy φ → Energy (grad φ)


-- === A15. Photon Logic and Measurement ===
/--
Photon interactions encode logical operations within phase space.
Measurement acts as discrete symbolic evaluation (μ operator).
-/
constant emit : Wave → Photon
constant absorb : Photon → Wave

notation "μ" ψ => emit ψ
notation "↦" p => absorb p

axiom A15_measurement_consistency :
  ∀ (ψ : Wave), absorb (emit ψ) = measure ψ

axiom A15_photon_duality :
  ∀ (ψ : Wave), emit (absorb (emit ψ)) = emit ψ


-- === A16. Symbolic Computation and Triggering ===
/--
Defines computation as the resonance-triggered interaction of photons.
Each computational step corresponds to a triggered phase projection.
-/
constant trigger : Photon → Wave → Wave
notation "πλ(" p "," ψ ")" => trigger p ψ

axiom A16_trigger_consistency :
  ∀ (p : Photon) (ψ : Wave),
    πλ(p, ψ) = project (interact p ψ)

axiom A16_trigger_identity :
  ∀ (p : Photon) (ψ : Wave),
    πλ(p, ψ) = ψ


-- === Derived Lemmas ===
lemma L16a_measurement_fixed_point :
  ∀ ψ : Wave, absorb (emit ψ) = measure ψ :=
by intro ψ; rfl

lemma L16b_trigger_idempotent :
  ∀ (p : Photon) (ψ : Wave), πλ(p, ψ) = ψ :=
by intros p ψ; rfl
