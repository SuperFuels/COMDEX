ðŸ”— Engine Sync Module
---------------------
â€¢ Handles twin-engine resonance synchronization (phase lock).
â€¢ Manages exhaust â†’ intake chaining for multi-engine amplification.
â€¢ Ensures resonance frequencies are averaged for stable phase alignment.
â€¢ Validates exhaust particle transfers safely before intake injection.

ðŸ”¥ Features:
    â€¢ Twin-engine resonance sync (F2) with averaged phase correction.
    â€¢ Exhaust-to-intake linkage for downstream chaining (F3).
    â€¢ Safe particle validation during exhaust transfer.
    â€¢ Future-ready: Supports expansion to multi-engine chaining pipelines (A â†’ B â†’ C).
