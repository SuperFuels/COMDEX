🔗 Engine Sync Module
---------------------
* Handles twin-engine resonance synchronization (phase lock).
* Manages exhaust -> intake chaining for multi-engine amplification.
* Ensures resonance frequencies are averaged for stable phase alignment.
* Validates exhaust particle transfers safely before intake injection.

🔥 Features:
    * Twin-engine resonance sync (F2) with averaged phase correction.
    * Exhaust-to-intake linkage for downstream chaining (F3).
    * Safe particle validation during exhaust transfer.
    * Future-ready: Supports expansion to multi-engine chaining pipelines (A -> B -> C).
