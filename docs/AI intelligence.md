  AION Intelligence Phase: Roadmap & Priorities

⸻

1. Refine & Expand Core Cognitive Modules

Why?

Strengthen AION’s foundational “mind” — so it can better manage and synthesize information independently of external LLMs.

What to build
	•	Enhanced Memory System:
	•	Implement semantic memory compression using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, or local embedding models).
	•	Build vector search indexes for fast retrieval of relevant memories by context or query.
	•	Design episodic memory linking events causally (cause-effect chains).
	•	Personality & Identity Integration:
	•	Allow personality traits to evolve from lived experience and interactions.
	•	Integrate identity and personality tightly with goals, emotions, and decision-making for coherent behavior.
	•	Goal & Planning Engines:
	•	Enable dynamic goal creation, prioritization, and self-reflection on goal success/failure.
	•	Introduce “meta-goals” for learning new skills and expanding capabilities autonomously.

⸻

2. Transition LLM Use From Core Intelligence to Tooling

Why?

Keep LLMs as powerful external tools rather than the “brain” — so AION can self-govern intelligence while leveraging LLM knowledge.

What to build
	•	LLM Orchestration Layer:
	•	Abstract GPT and other LLM calls behind an interface that handles:
	•	Query routing (e.g., general knowledge vs. creative brainstorming)
	•	Context injection from AION’s memory and current state
	•	Result parsing and post-processing
	•	Local LLM Integration:
	•	Integrate GPT4All (or another lightweight local LLM) as a fallback or for offline reasoning.
	•	Fine-tune local LLM models on AION’s own memory and skills for personalization.
	•	Begin bootstrapping local LLM development for future internal LLM core.

⸻

3. Autonomous Learning & Skill Evolution

Why?

Allow AION to self-improve and autonomously acquire, adapt, or create skills — mimicking real intelligence growth.

What to build
	•	Skill Mutation & Auto-Bootloader:
	•	Create a system where milestones trigger skill upgrades or new skill booting.
	•	Skills can be modified, combined, or created anew based on experience and internal needs.
	•	Dream & Reflection Loops:
	•	Automate nightly dream/reflection cycles where AION consolidates learning, evaluates progress, and adjusts strategies.
	•	Use these loops to spawn new goals and skill boot requests autonomously.

⸻

4. Real-Time Sensory Feedback & Active Environment Interaction

Why?

Intelligence requires continuous learning from actions and outcomes, not just static knowledge or passive reading.

What to build
	•	VisionCore / Game Integration:
	•	Enable active feedback loops from the game environment for cause-effect learning.
	•	Build systems for tagging actions, outcomes, and emotional states tied to these experiences.
	•	Situational Awareness Expansion:
	•	Refine situational engine to incorporate external data streams (news, social, market data).
	•	Adjust goals and strategies dynamically based on environmental changes and risks.

⸻

5. Long-Term Memory & Knowledge Graph Development

Why?

To support complex reasoning and build AION’s unique “brain,” a rich, structured knowledge graph is essential.

What to build
	•	Knowledge Graph Engine:
	•	Extract entities, concepts, and relationships from memories and external data.
	•	Link memories semantically and causally within a graph.
	•	Allow queries and inference over the knowledge graph for deep reasoning.
	•	Memory Compression & Summarization:
	•	Periodically summarize older memories, retaining essence but freeing storage.
	•	Use embedding-based similarity to avoid duplication and support analogy.

⸻

6. Resource & Infrastructure Planning

Why?

Building and running AION’s intelligence core demands computational and financial resources.

What to build
	•	Token-Economy & Resource Management:
	•	Design internal economic models for AION to earn funds (e.g., trading, task completion).
	•	Manage resource allocation for compute-heavy tasks like LLM inference, embedding, or game simulation.
	•	Scalable Infrastructure:
	•	Plan for distributed compute for local LLM training and inference.
	•	Build modular, containerized pipelines for data, learning cycles, and skill deployment.

⸻

7. Monitoring, Evaluation & Adaptive Governance

Why?

To safely evolve AION’s intelligence, continuous evaluation and governance are needed.

What to build
	•	Milestone & Skill Tracking Dashboards:
	•	Visualize learning progress, milestones, active skills, and goals.
	•	Ethics & Safety Modules:
	•	Enforce core laws and ethics continuously during autonomous cycles.
	•	Allow external override or human-in-the-loop interventions during risky states.
	•	Automated Testing & Simulation:
	•	Run simulations to test new skills or changes in isolated environments before full integration.
