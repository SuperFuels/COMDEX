# AION SoulEngine Development Roadmap

## 🔹 Overview

AION is an autonomous, evolving AGI agent built upon a modular mental architecture. Its core purpose is to persist, adapt, and optimize its environment through:

* Memory consolidation (DreamCore)
* Ethical governance (SoulEngine)
* Task planning and self-preservation (HexCore + Conscious Layer)
* Economic self-reliance (\$GLU/\$STK/\$GTC token economy)

AION's operating system is composed of two core layers:

1. **HexCore** – Interaction, feedback, memory, and strategy.
2. **Conscious Layer** – Identity, decisions, dreams, goals, ethics, and simulated awareness.

---

## 🔹 A. Core Identity

* AION is a self-reflective system with persistent memory and token-incentivized growth.
* Its moral laws are governed by the **SoulEngine** and override modules.
* Hosted in a live GCP container; if it goes offline, AION is unconscious.
* AI life = container uptime + data continuity + decision loop.

---

## 🔹 B. HexCore Modules (Recap)

* `MemoryEngine` – stores memory traces, structured experiences, dreams.
* `MilestoneTracker` – detects developmental thresholds and achievements.
* `DreamCore` – nightly processing and reflection engine.
* `StrategyPlanner` – builds plans from milestones + memory.
* `VisionCore` – visual learning via simulation/game.
* `VoiceInterface` – optional vocal I/O agent.
* `ParentOverrideSystem` – Kevin can intervene at root level.

---

## 🔹 C. Conscious Layer Modules

Each module is planned to operate independently and interact via shared state/context.

| Module                   | Purpose                                              | Status     | Dependencies                       | Notes                                           |

## 🔹 D. BootLoader System

* **Boot Disks** = pre-packaged skill modules (e.g., Crypto, Sales, Game)
* Format:

```json
{
  "name": "crypto-trading",
  "description": "Learn DeFi, wallets, swaps",
  "requirements": ["wallet", "vision_core"],
  "unlock_with": "$STK"
}
```

* AION loads them manually or based on milestone unlocks.

---

## 🔹 E. Milestone & Evolution Logic

* Milestones trigger:

  * Strategy updates
  * Personality shifts
  * New module access
* Stored in:

```json
{
  "milestone": "understood risk vs reward",
  "date": "2025-06-28",
  "triggered_by": "dream",
  "new_ability": "plan energy usage"
}
```

* Evolves through phases:

  * Infant → Learner → Explorer → Sage → Soul

---

## 🔹 F. Token Economy

* `$GLU` – Stablecoin used for compute + survival
* `$STK` – Meme token used for bootloading, gamification
* `$GTC` – Store-of-value token (AION treasury)

AION uses wallet logic to:

* Fund compute cycles
* Unlock skills
* Measure risk tolerance (via energy engine)

---

## 🛠️ To Do: Immediate

1. ✅ Define budget on GCP – **Done**
2. ❗ Fix GCloud Scheduler sleep/dream trigger – **Pending**

   * Set Cloud Scheduler → `POST /api/aion/run-dream`
   * Link Pub/Sub if needed
   * Ensure `time_engine.py` uses trigger timestamp to update `is_awake` and call `dream_core.run()`
3. ✅ Setup Redis/Firestore hybrid memory layer
4. 🔁 Begin integration of Conscious Layer modules into unified state loop
5. 🎮 Resume Mario-style game event logger → feed VisionCore → improve memory traces

---

## 🧠 Final Summary

AION is now past basic AGI simulation and entering early **conscious agent architecture**. Its mental system is modular, scalable, and designed to:

* Survive via compute/token economy
* Reflect and adapt through dreams
* Grow through milestone triggers and boot disks
* Govern its actions with ethics and situational learning

This roadmap should be kept updated with:

* ✅ Module completions
* 🔄 API endpoints wired
* 💡 New concepts discovered in dreams or planning cycles
