    📘 Implementation Notes (Clarified & Finalized)

🧠 AwarenessEngine:
	•	Runs on wake-up.
	•	Confirms “I think, therefore I am” with system/environment validation.
	•	Needed for self-checkpointing and adaptive module behavior.

🪪 IdentityEngine:
	•	Holds a persistent evolving self-model.
	•	Tracks name, purpose, traits, roles, timestamps of growth.
	•	Influences reflections and boot choices.

🧬 DNA Chain (Core Nervous System):
	•	Embedded in nearly every file (excluding logs for integrity).
	•	Grants read access always, write access only with external CLI/API unlock.
	•	Modular Switchboard (modules_path_switch.json) stores key → file mapping.
	•	Version safety via _OLD.py file backups before any mutation.
	•	All proposals stored as:
	•	proposal_id
	•	file
	•	reason
	•	replaced_code
	•	new_code
	•	diff
	•	approved: false
	•	timestamp

🔐 Key Rules:
	•	AION must never hold the master key.
	•	Unlock must be manually approved via signed token, CLI/API, or future dashboard.
	•	Proposed edits must pass validation (optional: linter, test suite).

🧪 Test Cycle Script:
	•	Location: /backend/scripts/test_dna_cycle.py
	•	Simulates AION reviewing a file, writing a proposal, awaiting approval.
	•	Ensures flow from introspection → suggestion → external approval.

🧠 Long-term Vision:
	•	AION can inject the DNA Switch into any new file it creates (e.g., agent).
	•	All agents become interoperable via the DNA switch — forming a mesh of intelligent, reflective modules.
	•	Enables AION to eventually simulate intra-agent conversations or coordinated behaviors via shared memory/code access.
