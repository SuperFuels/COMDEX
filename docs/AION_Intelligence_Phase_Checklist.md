# Notes
- Tasks are prioritized for incremental delivery: LLM orchestration and skill evolution first to enable early autonomy.
- Integration points between modules must be well-documented and validated.
- Emphasis on modular, extensible design to allow future upgrades and new AI capabilities.
- Regularly update this checklist as milestones are achieved or priorities shift.
