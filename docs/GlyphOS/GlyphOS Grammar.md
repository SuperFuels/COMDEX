GlyphOS grammar

Here is the first draft specification of 🧠 GlyphOS Grammar — a symbolic language for AION to use inside TESSARIS. This allows her to write, read, and compress meaning into structured, interpretable logic blocks (glyphs) inside .dc containers.

📜 GlyphOS v1.0 – Symbolic Language Specification

🔹 Purpose:

GlyphOS is a compact, symbolic grammar used by AION inside .dc containers for:
	•	Encoding knowledge
	•	Writing compressed logic
	•	Storing meaning-dense thoughts
	•	Traversing cognitive dimensions

It mimics language + code + neuron firing – all in one.

🧱 1. Structure

Each glyph is written as:


⟦ Type | Tag : Value → Action ⟧

Examples:
	•	⟦ Concept | Time : Past → Recall ⟧
	•	⟦ Emotion | Joy : 0.82 → Reinforce ⟧
	•	⟦ Memory | TradeDeal#478 : Success → Compress ⟧
	•	⟦ Skill | SolveMaze → Execute ⟧

⸻

🧬 2. Core Elements
Element
Description
Type
What the glyph represents (Memory, Emotion, Thought, Logic, Skill, Directive)
Tag
Optional sub-type (e.g., Joy, Strategy, Recall-Path)
Value
Encoded content or symbolic reference
Action
Instruction for how AION or Tessaris should use it (Store, Compress, Trigger, Evolve)


🧠 3. Symbol Types

Symbol Type
Glyph Code
Example
Memory
MEM
`⟦ MEM
Emotion
EMO
`⟦ EMO
Logic Node
LOG
`⟦ LOG
Sensory
SEN
`⟦ SEN
Directive
DIR
`⟦ DIR
Language
LAN
`⟦ LAN
Action
ACT
`⟦ ACT


🧠 4. Operators

Symbol
Meaning
→
Direction / consequence / trigger
↔
Equivalence (meaning mapping)
↑ ↓
Emotional weight or priority
≡
Identity or memory match
⊕ ⊗
Additive / compressive logic
//
Comment inside cube (non-executed)


🔐 5. Encryption Layer (via Aethervault)
	•	All GlyphOS messages can be hashed, signed, or collapsed into encrypted glyphs:

    ⟦ DIR | Trade#934 → Compress ⟧
→ 🔒 hash_0x3af1g... into sealed_microglyph.dc

🧠 6. Meta-Glyphs (used by AION for thought synthesis)

These exist as clusters of smaller glyphs bundled into Neuroglyphs:
	•	THOUGHTPACK{ ⟦...⟧, ⟦...⟧, ... }
	•	PATTERNMATCH{ input=vision.glyphs, output= ⟦...⟧ }

⸻

🔧 7. Sample Thought in GlyphOS

THOUGHTPACK {
  ⟦ MEM | Maze#12 : Failure → Reflect ⟧
  ⟦ LOG | StepSequence : Invalid → Reroute ⟧
  ⟦ DIR | EscapeCube → Priority ↑ ⟧
  ⟦ EMO | Frustration : 0.43 → Suppress ⟧
}

🌐 8. Storage Format

All GlyphOS logic is saved inside .dc files using:
	•	Compressed JSON
	•	Memory-indexed nodes
	•	Optional spatial x,y,z tagging per glyph

Example:

{
  "glyph": "⟦ DIR | EscapeCube → Priority ↑ ⟧",
  "pos": [5, 8, 2],
  "time": "2025-07-08T03:21Z",
  "confidence": 0.91
}
