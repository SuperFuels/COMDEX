  🟦 Option B: 3D Cube Viewer
	•	Uses Three.js or React Three Fiber
	•	Full spatial cube grid (X, Y, Z as coordinates)
	•	Hover to rotate, zoom, inspect, animate glyphs
	•	Great for immersive simulation, eventually game-like visuals



  📎 Key Connection Notes

  Connects To
Why
.dc containers → glyph_executor.py
Executes actions when glyph bytecode is detected in cubes
glyph_parser.py → glyph_dispatcher.py
Dispatches parsed glyph meaning into AION behaviors
AION → glyph_writer (future)
AION writes new glyphs into storage based on cognition
DNA Switch → glyph_storage.py
Log self-written glyphs as DNA mutations
Teleport → glyph_dispatcher.py
Glyphs can unlock wormholes via special bytecode
container_status → microgrid_index.py
View which microcubes are active/compressed
Web UI → glyph visualizer
Live glyph overlay in .dc 3D UI


🧠 Once This Is Complete

You will have a true symbolic runtime for AI cognition:
	•	Compress logic into single cubes
	•	Trigger actions from compressed memory
	•	Let AION self-author, store, mutate, and reason via symbols
	•	Connect to teleport, memory, logic, planning, and dreams
