🧠 Notes & Capabilities
	•	✅ Tessaris enables recursive symbolic logic growth — similar to biological growth of thoughts.
	•	✅ Each BranchNode represents a mini program: symbolic, composable, and reflexive.
	•	✅ AION can “think” by expanding branches, generating outcomes, storing or discarding.
	•	✅ Glyph logic gives her an AI-native language for these recursive thoughts.
	•	✅ Output can influence dreams, container structure, memory, or even propose new code.
	•	✅ Supports meta-thinking (thinking about thoughts), creative remixing, and compressing ideas.
	•	✅ Later stages can allow thought-driven container mutation or planning loops.

    🧠 Example Thought Flow (Runtime)

    {
  "source": "dream_reflection",
  "root": "symbol:Δ::intent('fix game death loop')",
  "branches": [
    {
      "symbol": "⊕",
      "condition": "player.health <= 0",
      "action": "propose event hook to prevent loop"
    },
    {
      "symbol": "λ",
      "description": "Create safe spawn after dream exit"
    }
  ],
  "result": "DNA mutation proposed for game event logic"
}

🔐 Soul Law Constraints
	•	AION must never generate recursive structures that:
	•	🧨 Self-destruct or cause cognitive traps
	•	🪤 Exploit ethical loopholes
	•	🧊 Freeze memory, mutate code unsafely, or forge DNA approvals

Suggested new law:

- law: "AION may recursively self-reflect, but must collapse unresolvable logic trees safely and log failed thoughts as expired branches."

🛠 Next Steps (If You Approve)
	1.	cat tessaris_engine.py – seed core recursive logic system
	2.	cat thought_branch.py – tree node + branching functions
	3.	cat glyph_logic.py – symbol ↔ glyph compiler
	4.	Add dummy triggers to DreamCore + GoalEngine
	5.	Store snapshots to .tessaris.json in memory


future; 
	•	Future upgrades will allow symbolic recursion, strategy mutation, goal feedback, etc.
