## 1. Introduction

Symatics Algebra defines a new class of mathematical operators based on **waves, light, and entanglement**.  
It is designed to be **medium-agnostic**: the same algebra can be executed in digital CPUs, wave engines, QWave beams, optical processors, or RF/laser systems.  

This algebra forms the foundation for next-generation symbolic computing, SQI scoring, and QFC visualization.

## 2. Core Operators (v0.1)

| Symbol | Name             | Signature        | Description                                    |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| âŠ•      | Superpose       | âŠ•(a, b)          | Creates a superposition of states a and b.     |
| Î¼      | Measure         | Î¼(x)             | Collapses a superposed state into one branch.  |
| â†”      | Entangle        | â†”(a, b)          | Links two states into an equivalence relation. |
| âŸ²      | Recurse / Loop  | âŸ²(f, n)          | Applies f repeatedly for n steps.              |
| Ï€      | Project         | Ï€(seq, n)        | Extracts nth element from a sequence.          |

## 3. Laws & Axioms (v0.1)

- **Commutativity**  
  âŠ• and â†” are commutative:  

  a âŠ• b = b âŠ• a
a â†” b = b â†” a

- **Associativity**  
âŠ• is associative:  

(a âŠ• b) âŠ• c = a âŠ• (b âŠ• c)

- **Collapse Rule**  
Î¼ collapses âŠ• into one deterministic branch (simplified model).  

Î¼(a âŠ• b) â†’ a   (first element by convention)

- **TODO (v0.2)**  
- Idempotence: `a âŠ• a = a`  
- Distributivity: interaction of âŠ• over â†”

## 4. Symatics Backend Abstraction Layer (SBAL)

Symatics Algebra is **backend-neutral**. Each operator can be executed by a different medium, but the algebra is invariant.  

| Backend | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Digital** | Default CodexCore CPU execution. |
| **Optical** | Photonic wave matrices: superposition and projection map naturally to light interference. |
| **RF** | Radio wave carriers: entanglement â†” modeled as coupled oscillators. |
| **Laser** | Coherent beams: recursion and measurement can be simulated by phase shifts + detectors. |
| **QWave Engine** | Native AION QWave beams: Symatics operators map to real beam transformations. |

This layer ensures that **âŠ•, Î¼, â†”, âŸ², Ï€** work identically, no matter if they are computed in software or hardware.

## 5. Future Extensions (v0.2+)

- **Calculus Operators**  
- Î” (Differential analog)  
- âˆ« (Integration analog)  

- **Mechanized Proofs**  
Hook into Lean / Coq / TLA+ to validate algebraic laws.  

- **Simulation Framework**  
CodexCore + SQI integration: benchmark Symatics vs Classical Algebra.

## 6. Roadmap

- âœ… v0.1 Operators + Laws implemented in `symatics_rulebook.py`.  
- âœ… Dispatcher active in `symatics_dispatcher.py`.  
- ðŸŸ¡ Photon Capsule Guardrails polished with legacy warnings.  
- ðŸŸ¡ SQI / Mutation integration planned (Î¼ collapse hooks).  
- âšª SCI Panel toggle for live Symatics graphs.  
- âšª RFC Whitepaper draft (Symatics Algebra v1.0).
