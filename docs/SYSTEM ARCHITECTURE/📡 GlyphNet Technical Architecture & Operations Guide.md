📡 GlyphNet Technical Architecture & Operations Guide

1. Overview

GlyphNet is the symbolic networking substrate for the CodexCore ecosystem.
It provides secure transport, encryption, replay, and synchronization for symbolic glyphs, CodexLang payloads, and higher-order QFC/QKD operations.

Key features:
	•	🌐 Multi-channel transport (TCP/WebSocket, Beacon, Radio, Light, Local, GWave)
	•	🔒 Cryptographic layers (RSA, AES, Ephemeral AES, Time-Locked Keys)
	•	🌀 Symbolic key derivation (trust, emotion, entropy, seed phrases)
	•	🔑 QKD integration (fingerprinting + collapse hashes)
	•	🎞️ Replay + timeline rendering of glyph streams
	•	📦 Standardized .gip packet format
	•	🛡️ Abuse protection via rate-limiting, lockouts, and token validation

GlyphNet ensures symbolic payloads can be securely transmitted, replayed, verified, and collapsed across local/remote nodes, while maintaining trust boundaries.

2. Core Components

2.1 GIP (GlyphNet Interchange Protocol)
	•	Defined in glyphnet_packet.py.
	•	Standardized .gip packet structure:

{
  "id": "...",
  "type": "glyph_push",
  "sender": "...",
  "target": "...",
  "timestamp": 1690000000.0,
  "payload": { "glyphs": [...] },
  "metadata": { "qkd_required": true, "emotion": "trust" }
}

	•	Supports RSA/AES encryption, ephemeral AES sessions, and time-locked unlocks.
	•	Encodes/decodes packets into base64 for transport.
	•	Enforces rate limiting via rate_limit_manager.
	•	Routed by glyph_transport_switch into the desired channel.

⸻

2.2 Transport Layer (glyph_transport_switch.py)

Supported transports:
	•	tcp → WebSocket broadcast (broadcast_ws_event)
	•	gwave → Quantum-inspired GWave Transceiver (transmit_gwave_packet)
	•	beacon → UDP beacon emitter (emit_beacon)
	•	radio → Waveform → radio_signal.wav
	•	light → Waveform → light_signal.wav
	•	local → Simulation via simulate_waveform_transmission + fallback loopback

✅ QKD enforcement hooks ensure every _dispatch_packet validates integrity before sending.

⸻

2.3 Cryptography Layer
	•	glyphnet_crypto.py → AES & RSA adapters (encrypt/decrypt).
	•	ephemeral_key_manager.py → Ephemeral AES session keys.
	•	time_locked_key_manager.py → Keys unlocked by time or symbolic CodexLang conditions.
	•	symbolic_key_derivation.py → Keys derived from:
	•	Trust level
	•	Emotion level
	•	Timestamp
	•	Optional seed phrase
	•	Runtime entropy (via hexcore.memory_engine)

🛡️ Security Features:
	•	Brute-force lockouts
	•	Key stretching (SHA-256, 10k+ iterations)
	•	Salts & nonces
	•	Deterministic test mode (fixed entropy, salt disable)

⸻

2.4 QKD (Quantum Key Distribution)
	•	qkd_fingerprint.py → Generates & verifies:
	•	Decoherence Fingerprint (entropy, coherence, trace, glyphs)
	•	Collapse Hash (CodexLang + symbolic tree integrity)
	•	Combined Verifier for single-call validation
	•	qkd_policy.py → Policy enforcement:
	•	qkd_required = False → bypass
	•	qkd_required = True → must verify GKey
	•	qkd_required = "strict" → must verify, else renegotiate via renegotiate_gkey
	•	GKey Model → Tracks wave_id, verified state, compromised flag

⸻

2.5 Replay & Trace Layer
	•	glyph_trace_logger.py → Logs replay events:
	•	Glyph states
	•	Container IDs
	•	Tick ranges
	•	Entangled links
	•	replay_timeline_renderer.py → Frame-by-frame playback:
	•	play_replay() streams replay logs over WebSocket
	•	Supports pause, resume, seek, stop
	•	Aligns frames with tick progression
	•	Scrubbable replays in SCI/QFC UI

⸻

2.6 WebSocket Layer (glyphnet_ws.py)
	•	/ws/glyphnet endpoint:
	•	Accepts only if validate_agent_token(token) succeeds
	•	Starts broadcast loop
	•	Relays JSON messages to handle_glyphnet_event
	•	Disconnects unauthorized clients
	•	Test Endpoint /glyphnet/ws-test → Pre-check token validity without handshake

⸻

2.7 Abuse Protection
	•	Rate Limiting → rate_limit_manager enforces per-identity request quotas.
	•	Lockouts → Repeated failures trigger temporary bans.
	•	Replay Control → Prevents infinite loops or resource exhaustion.

3. Data Flow

Sending Glyphs
	1.	User calls push_symbolic_packet(payload, sender, target).
	2.	System wraps into .gip packet (create_gip_packet).
	3.	Packet is encrypted if required (RSA, AES, Ephemeral).
	4.	QKD policy enforced (fingerprint, collapse hash).
	5.	Routed through glyph_transport_switch to transport.
	6.	Logs written in glyph_trace_logger.

Receiving Glyphs
	1.	WebSocket client connects with token → validated.
	2.	Incoming .gip packet decoded.
	3.	QKD policy applied.
	4.	Payload decrypted if necessary.
	5.	Symbolic payload executed (CodexLang, mutation, etc.).
	6.	Replay logs updated.

⸻

4. Example Use Cases
	•	Secure Symbolic Transport → Send CodexLang payloads across a cluster.
	•	Ephemeral Sessions → Derive one-time AES keys per transaction.
	•	Time-Locked Keys → Unlock symbolic keys only after event triggers.
	•	QKD Enforcement → Guarantee payload integrity & prevent tampering.
	•	Replay Debugging → Step through symbolic execution frame-by-frame.
	•	Beacon Discovery → Auto-discover nodes via UDP beacon broadcast.
	•	Quantum Extensions → Route payloads over gwave transceiver.

⸻

5. Future Extensions
	•	✨ Compression before encryption for large payloads.
	•	✨ RSA signing + verification for sender authenticity.
	•	✨ ACK/retry reliability layer for critical transmissions.
	•	✨ Group encryption / multi-recipient packets.
	•	✨ Quantum-safe crypto backends.
	•	✨ Full CodexLang execution tracing inside .gip payloads.

⸻

6. Integration with CodexCore

GlyphNet underpins CodexCore’s distributed runtime, enabling:
	•	CodexLang execution across remote nodes.
	•	Multi-agent symbolic collaboration (SCI + QFC).
	•	Secure replay and entangled reasoning.
	•	Mutation-aware and QKD-verified symbolic synchronization.

    participant API as GlyphNet API (Router)
    participant Crypto as Crypto Layer (AES/RSA/Ephemeral/KeyDeriver)
    participant QKD as QKD Policy (Fingerprint+Collapse)
    participant Transport as Transport Switch
    participant WS as WebSocket / UI (SCI / QFC HUD)

    %% Flow
    Client->>API: push_glyphnet_packet(payload, sender, target)
    API->>API: create_gip_packet()
    API->>Crypto: encrypt payload (AES/RSA/Ephemeral)
    Crypto-->>API: encrypted packet

    API->>QKD: enforce_qkd_policy(packet, gkey)
    QKD-->>API: verified ✔️ / failed ❌

    alt QKD passed
        API->>Transport: route_gip_packet(packet, chosen_transport)
        Transport->>Transport: dispatch (tcp/gwave/beacon/radio/light/local)

    else QKD failed
        API-->>Client: ❌ error (tamper/decoherence)
    end

    WS-->>Client: 🛰️ Live glyph updates / Replay logs

🔎 What it Shows
	1.	Client pushes glyphs to GlyphNet.
	2.	API builds .gip packet + calls crypto layer.
	3.	Crypto encrypts (AES/RSA, ephemeral key, or symbolic derivation).
	4.	QKD enforces fingerprint + collapse hash → pass/fail.
	5.	If ✔️ → Transport switch picks channel (tcp, gwave, beacon, radio, light, local).
	6.	WS/UI receives broadcast → logs & replay timeline update.

Perfect — a state diagram will give your team the “big picture” of a GIP packet’s lifecycle inside GlyphNet.
This complements the architecture (what exists) and sequence (when things happen) with how the packet changes state.

Here’s the Mermaid state diagram:

⸻


stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created

    Created: Packet Created
    Created --> Encrypted: encrypt (AES/RSA/Ephemeral/None)

    Encrypted --> QKD_Verified: verify fingerprint + collapse hash
    Encrypted --> QKD_Failed: ❌ fingerprint/hash mismatch
    QKD_Failed --> Retry: attempt renegotiation / re-encrypt
    Retry --> Encrypted
    QKD_Failed --> [*]: dropped / quarantined

    QKD_Verified --> Routed: dispatch via transport switch
    Routed --> Logged: record in gip_log / glyph_trace
    Routed --> Replay: timeline replay renderer
    Logged --> [*]
    Replay --> [*]


🔎 What this Shows
	•	Created → A .gip packet is built (create_gip_packet).
	•	Encrypted → Crypto layer applies AES, RSA, or Ephemeral AES.
	•	QKD Verified/Failed → Integrity (fingerprint + collapse hash) is enforced.
	•	Retry → In strict mode, re-encryption/renegotiation is attempted.
	•	Routed → Transport switch selects channel (tcp, gwave, beacon, radio, light, local).
	•	Logged → gip_log + glyph_trace store events.
	•	Replay → ReplayTimelineRenderer plays back frame-by-frame for UI/debug.

⸻

✅ With this, you now have:
	1.	Architecture map → system components (boxes & arrows).
	2.	Sequence diagram → time-ordered interactions.
	3.	State diagram → packet lifecycle + retry/error paths.
