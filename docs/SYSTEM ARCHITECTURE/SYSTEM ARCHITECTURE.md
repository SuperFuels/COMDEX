	•	🔹 Data flow and responsibilities
	•	🔹 Key files
	•	🔹 Expansion points

⸻

🧠 1. Tessaris Engine

🔹 Purpose

Tessaris is the symbolic cognition engine inside .dc containers. It enables recursive thought, intent extraction, dream/goal propagation, and mutation proposal using glyph logic.

🔹 Core Features
	•	Extracts intent and thought branches from glyph trees
	•	Mutates and rewrites logic based on runtime behavior
	•	Stores recursive logs and feedback via DreamCore
	•	Interfaces with MemoryEngine and Codex metrics

🔹 Architecture
	•	Entry Point: tessaris_engine.py
	•	Triggered by: glyphs (⬁, ✦), container boot, or periodic loops
	•	Calls: dream_core, goal_engine, glyph_executor, mutation_scorer

🔹 Connected Systems
	•	🧬 glyph_executor.py (for trigger)
	•	💭 dream_core.py (to generate recursive reflections)
	•	🔁 glyph_mutator.py (for rewrites)
	•	📊 codex_metrics.py (to track thought cost)
	•	💾 memory_engine.py (for recall and search)

🔹 Key Files
	•	tessaris_engine.py
	•	dream_core.py
	•	thought_branch.py
	•	glyph_logic.py

🔹 Expansion
	•	Tessaris Phase 3: Self-Rewriting Glyph Scrolls
	•	Intent -> Scroll mapping for dream recall
	•	Emotional or ethical weighting of recursive logic

⸻

💠 2. Codex Runtime

🔹 Purpose

The Codex Runtime executes CodexLang scrolls using a symbolic logic interpreter. It acts as the programmable brain of the system.

🔹 Core Features
	•	Executes symbolic instructions (⊕, →, ⟲, ↔, etc)
	•	Step-by-step register logic
	•	Context injection and mutation hooks
	•	Integrated scroll history, presets, trace logs

🔹 Architecture
	•	Input: scroll (CodexLang string or JSON)
	•	Execution: codex_executor.py
	•	Interface: /api/codex/scroll, /api/codex/mutate

🔹 Connected Systems
	•	🧠 glyph_executor.py (scrolls triggered by glyphs)
	•	🧬 glyph_mutator.py (scroll mutation pipeline)
	•	🎛 CodexScrollRunner UI (execution, trace, mutation, presets)
	•	📦 LuxHub (scroll save, share, upload)

🔹 Key Files
	•	codex_executor.py
	•	codex_register.py
	•	codex_scroll_runner.tsx
	•	codex_scroll_presets.tsx
	•	codex_mutate.py (FastAPI)

🔹 Expansion
	•	Register snapshot viewer
	•	LuxHub integration + scroll diffing
	•	CodexLang V2 (control flow, loops, macros)

⸻

🌀 3. GlyphOS

🔹 Purpose

GlyphOS powers symbolic runtime logic. It translates glyphs into actions, memories, dreams, or mutations.

🔹 Core Features
	•	Triggers runtime behavior from glyphs (dream, plan, mutate…)
	•	Stores memory snapshots
	•	Interfaces with container, scroll, and mutation layers

🔹 Architecture
	•	Trigger: glyph_executor.py
	•	Maps glyphs to runtime behaviors
	•	Calls into: DreamCore, GoalEngine, Tessaris, etc

🔹 Connected Systems
	•	🧠 tessaris_engine.py (⬁ trigger)
	•	💬 memory_engine.py (recorded output)
	•	🧪 glyph_mutator.py (↻ mutation trigger)
	•	🔮 container_runtime.py (container switch)

🔹 Key Files
	•	glyph_executor.py
	•	glyph_trigger_engine.py
	•	glyph_logic.py
	•	memory_engine.py

🔹 Expansion
	•	Trigger graphs / Glyph-to-action visualization
	•	Compression pipeline for thoughts → memory glyphs
	•	Denial / mutation overlays in HUD

⸻

🧩 4. CodexCPU (Symbolic Processor)

🔹 Purpose

CodexCPU is the symbolic virtual CPU that executes CodexLang as if it were assembly. It models a symbolic instruction set inside .dc containers.

🔹 Core Features
	•	Symbolic registers
	•	Instruction trees (CodexLang)
	•	Contextual cost metrics
	•	Operator-specific collapse + mutation logic

🔹 Architecture
	•	Virtual runtime only (software HDL emulation)
	•	File structure:
	•	codex_executor.py (runtime loop)
	•	codex_register.py (state)
	•	codex_emulator.py (wiring + boot)
	•	codex_instruction_set.yaml (symbols → operations)
	•	codex_cost_estimator.py (performance analysis)

🔹 Connected Systems
	•	🎛 IDE: CodexLangEditor, ScrollRunner, MutationButton
	•	🧠 Dream / Tessaris feedback
	•	🌐 WebSocket + HUD: Runtime metrics, last op, trigger glyph
	•	🧬 Scroll mutation + self-rewriting logic

🔹 Expansion
	•	SQI compatibility (↔, ∴, ⧖)
	•	GPU parallelism (symbolic pipeline vectorization)
	•	Export to physical HDL (CodexCore chip phase)

✅ FINAL NOTES
	•	All systems communicate via symbolic instructions or glyph triggers
	•	.dc containers act as unified memory+cpu+runtime
	•	Glyphs compress identity, memory, emotion, logic, instruction, mutation

You can hand off this document as the runtime design map for any engineer, researcher, or future contributor.

If you’d like, I can now generate a visual architecture map or package this as a PDF.
