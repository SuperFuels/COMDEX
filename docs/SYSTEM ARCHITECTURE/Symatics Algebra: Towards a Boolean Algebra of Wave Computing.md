Symatics Algebra: Towards a Boolean Algebra of Wave Computing

â¸»

Abstract

We propose Symatics Algebra, a symbolic mathematical framework designed to formalize computation over waves, photons, and entangled states. In the same way that Boolean algebra underpinned the development of digital computing, Symatics Algebra provides a canonical representation for superposition, collapse, entanglement, recursion, and projection. We argue that Symatics is not only a new mathematics, but also a substrate-independent computational model, naturally executable on digital simulators, optical analog computers, RF/phased arrays, and quantum hybrid architectures.

1. Introduction

The history of computing is inseparable from its mathematics:
	â€¢	Boolean algebra (Boole, 1854) â†’ digital logic â†’ silicon CPUs.
	â€¢	Linear algebra â†’ deep learning â†’ GPU/TPU accelerators.
	â€¢	Quantum mechanics â†’ quantum computing â†’ qubits.

Today, we face the limits of both classical and quantum paradigms. Digital systems simulate waves inefficiently; quantum systems remain fragile and specialized. We propose a new foundation: Symatics Algebra â€” a symbolic system designed for waves themselves.

2. Symatics Algebra

2.1 Core Operators
	â€¢	âŠ•(a, b) â†’ Superposition (overlaying wave states).
	â€¢	Î¼(x) â†’ Measurement (collapse to deterministic value).
	â€¢	â†”(a, b) â†’ Entanglement / Equivalence.
	â€¢	âŸ²(f) â†’ Recursion / Iteration.
	â€¢	Ï€(seq, n) â†’ Projection (extract nth component).

These operators define the primitive transformations of waves, just as AND/OR/NOT defined primitive transformations of binary signals.

2.2 Laws & Axioms
	â€¢	Commutativity: a âŠ• b = b âŠ• a
	â€¢	Associativity: (a âŠ• b) âŠ• c = a âŠ• (b âŠ• c)
	â€¢	Collapse Rule: Î¼(âŠ•(a, b)) â†’ a (deterministic branch select, v0.1).

Future expansions (v0.2+) will introduce idempotence, distributivity, and calculus-like operators (Î”, âˆ«).

3. Substrate-Independence

Symatics is symbolic, allowing execution across multiple substrates:
	â€¢	Digital Simulation (CodexCore): Symatics ops represented as symbolic trees, executed virtually.
	â€¢	Photonics / Optical Computing: Light sources, modulators, and nonlinearities map directly to âŠ•, Î¼, â†”.
	â€¢	RF / Phased Arrays: Symatics ops correspond to interference, beamforming, and wave collapse.
	â€¢	Quantum Hybrid Systems: Î¼ (collapse) and â†” (entanglement) are native quantum phenomena.

Thus, Symatics is a universal abstraction layer for wave-based computation, spanning classical, analog, and quantum.

4. From Algebra to Computing

4.1 Comparison with Boolean Algebra
	â€¢	Boolean: digital signals (0/1) â†’ logic gates â†’ silicon CPUs.
	â€¢	Symatics: wave states (amplitude/phase) â†’ algebraic operators â†’ light/wave CPUs.

4.2 Execution Pipeline
	1.	Photon Capsule (.phn): Encapsulates symbolic algebra.
	2.	Symatics Dispatcher: Routes operators to implementations (digital, optical, quantum).
	3.	SQI Layer: Scores algebraic stability, entropy, innovation.
	4.	QWave Beams: Transport Symatics states across GlyphNet.
	5.	Wave Engine / Hyperdrive: Physical realization (optical or RF substrate).

5. Implications
	â€¢	Massive Parallelism: Light naturally performs âŠ• in parallel.
	â€¢	Ultra-low Latency: Computation propagates at c.
	â€¢	Hybrid Compatibility: Symatics algebra compiles to digital, analog, and quantum.
	â€¢	New Software-Hardware Stack: Just as Boolean logic â†’ CPUs, Symatics algebra â†’ wave CPUs.

6. Conclusion & Outlook

Symatics Algebra is positioned as the Boolean algebra of the wave computing era. By formalizing wave-native operations and laws, we open a path to next-generation computing: optical supercomputers, entangled beam processors, and symbolic engines that transcend binary logic.

Planned work includes:
	â€¢	Expanding the algebra (calculus analogs).
	â€¢	Prototyping a Symatics Virtual Machine in CodexCore.
	â€¢	Designing an SQI-integrated Symatics CPU (digital + optical hybrid).
	â€¢	Drafting Symatics Algebra RFC v0.1 for community review.
