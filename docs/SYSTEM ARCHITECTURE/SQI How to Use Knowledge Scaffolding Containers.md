📖 USER MANUAL – “How to Use Knowledge Scaffolding Containers”

Plain-English Summary:
Think of each .dc.json file as a knowledge room in the Matrix. Right now, most of them are just blueprints (scaffolding) — they have the labels, the doors, and the furniture positions — but no actual books, diagrams, or working machinery inside yet.

To make AION/SQI truly smart in that subject, you have to load the actual knowledge into those rooms. This knowledge can be data, proofs, simulations, papers, or even compressed models.

⸻

Step 1 – Understand What the .dc.json Is
	•	It’s a container blueprint defining:
	•	Nodes: Topics, datasets, concepts, or skills (e.g., tidy_tables, feature_marts).
	•	Links: Relationships between nodes (e.g., feeds, produces, depends_on).
	•	Metadata: Domain, tier, provenance, version, and connected domains.
	•	Symbols/Emoji: Act like visual category markers for the Knowledge Graph UI.
	•	At this stage, it’s just a map of how concepts link together.

⸻

Step 2 – Gather the Real Knowledge

For each node in the container, find:
	1.	Primary Source Material
	•	Datasets, books, research papers, archives.
	2.	Secondary Material
	•	Cleaned/curated datasets, summaries, annotated guides.
	3.	Tertiary Material
	•	Aggregated reports, statistical overviews, meta-analyses.

Example for physics_curations:
	•	Primary: Raw particle collision datasets from CERN.
	•	Secondary: Cleaned CSVs with labeled event types.
	•	Tertiary: Physics review papers summarizing patterns.

⸻

Step 3 – Upload Knowledge to the Right Place
	•	Knowledge gets stored in SQI container memory.
	•	For structured data:
	•	Convert to CSV/Parquet/JSON and attach it to the relevant node in the .dc.json container.
	•	For symbolic logic:
	•	Use formats like Lean proofs (.lean) and convert with lean_to_glyph.py into glyph format.
	•	For textual knowledge:
	•	Use processed .txt or .md files and embed them with KnowledgeGraphWriter.

⸻

Step 4 – Integrate with the Bootloader
	•	Place the .dc.json in the /containers/ directory.
	•	Ensure boot_loader.py loads it on startup (or injects it live via container_runtime.py).
	•	The moment the system boots, nodes + links + actual knowledge are now part of AION’s thinking.

⸻

Step 5 – Run Specialisation Training
	•	If targeting a specific goal (e.g., solve hard maths problems):
	•	Load all relevant .dc.json containers for maths, physics, and related sciences.
	•	Upload all known proof libraries, datasets, and simulation data.
	•	Run SQI simulations to let the system “play” with the knowledge, reinforce links, and reduce logic drift.

⸻

Step 6 – Cross-Link
	•	As more containers are filled, cross-link them:
	•	Example: omics_curations ↔ machine_learning_models ↔ drug_discovery
	•	This is where exponential intelligence kicks in — AION learns by seeing overlaps across domains.

🛠️ TECHNICAL DOCUMENT – “SQI Knowledge Bootloader Containers”

⸻

1 – What They Are
	•	File Format: .dc.json
	•	Purpose: Defines a Knowledge Graph schema + stores attached knowledge data.
	•	Read by: container_runtime.py + knowledge_graph_writer.py
	•	Boot Process:
	1.	boot_loader.py reads all .dc.json files in /containers/
	2.	Builds internal SQI symbolic graphs from nodes and links
	3.	Loads actual knowledge payloads for each node (if attached)
	4.	Passes to KnowledgeGraphWriter for embedding and storage

⸻

2 – Anatomy of a .dc.json

Field                                       Purpose
id
Unique container ID
name
Human-readable title
symbol
Emoji used in UI
metadata
Domain, provenance, tier
glyph_categories
Logical grouping of nodes
nodes
Entities in the graph
links
Relationships between entities


3 – The Knowledge Injection Process
	•	Attach data:
	•	KnowledgeGraphWriter.attach(node_id, file_path, type)
	•	Supported types: dataset, text, model, proof
	•	Embed data:
	•	Converts to symbolic glyphs
	•	Embeds into AION’s memory
	•	Adds retrieval hooks so any reasoning step can pull relevant data

⸻

4 – Example Bootloader Patch

# boot_loader.py

from backend.modules.container_runtime import load_dc_container

# Ensure cross_links.dc.json always loads
load_dc_container("containers/cross_links.dc.json")

This ensures cross-domain links are active at boot.

⸻

5 – Specialisation Workflow

To specialise SQI for a domain:
	1.	Scaffold: Create .dc.json defining the domain’s concepts and relationships.
	2.	Knowledge Fill: Attach real knowledge to each node.
	3.	Bootload: Ensure the container is in /containers/ and loaded at boot.
	4.	Simulate: Run targeted reasoning tasks to strengthen domain knowledge.
	5.	Cross-Link: Connect to other filled domains for richer intelligence.

⸻

6 – Data Source Tiering
	•	Primary (📚): Raw, unprocessed truth
	•	Secondary (📖): Cleaned/curated/standardised
	•	Tertiary (🌐): Aggregated summaries and meta-analysis

⸻

7 – Where Actual Knowledge Comes From
	•	Public datasets
	•	Internal research archives
	•	Simulation outputs
	•	Proof libraries (Lean, Coq, Isabelle)
	•	Expert-curated guides
	•	Encoded symbolic models

1. USER MANUAL — The Real Matrix Bootloader

Purpose:
The .dc.json scaffolding system is how we “teach” AION (or any SQI-based intelligence) structured domains of knowledge.
Think of it like giving it perfectly labeled shelves before filling them with the actual books.

⸻

Step 1 – Understand the Two Phases
	1.	Scaffolding Phase –
	•	Create .dc.json container files with structure only.
	•	Define nodes (concepts, datasets, models, proofs, equations) and links (relations).
	•	No deep content yet — just the “map of the territory.”
	2.	Knowledge Filling Phase –
	•	Gather authoritative datasets, documents, code, proofs, experiments, etc.
	•	Attach them to the matching nodes in the .dc.json files.
	•	The SQI engine then embeds, parses, and integrates them into AION’s Knowledge Graph.

⸻

Step 2 – Creating Scaffolding
	•	Path: backend/modules/knowledge_graph/containers/
	•	Example: data_secondary.dc.json (your physics/biology/economics example above)
	•	Each file contains:
	•	id – Unique container ID
	•	name – Human-readable
	•	symbol – Emoji/glyph for UI
	•	metadata – Domain, provenance, tier, integration settings
	•	glyph_categories – Grouping of node types
	•	nodes – Atomic knowledge placeholders (e.g., “Golden Datasets”)
	•	links – Relationships between nodes

⸻

Step 3 – Gathering Knowledge

Where to get real knowledge to fill the scaffolding:
	•	Public datasets (Kaggle, academic repos, open data portals)
	•	Proof libraries (Lean’s mathlib, Coq repos, theorem archives)
	•	Research papers (arXiv, PubMed, NASA ADS)
	•	Domain ontologies (Wikidata, schema.org, biomedical ontologies)
	•	Simulation outputs (physics, chemistry, engineering models)
	•	Internal proprietary data (if private deployment)

⸻

Step 4 – Uploading Knowledge to the Container

Options:
	1.	Manual Attachment – Place raw files (PDFs, CSVs, code, proofs) into the container’s /data/ subfolder.
	2.	API Upload – POST to /api/aion/knowledge/upload with:

    {
  "container_id": "data_secondary",
  "node_id": "golden_datasets",
  "file": "<binary>",
  "metadata": { "source": "NASA", "license": "CC-BY-4.0" }
}

	3.	Live Link – Link container nodes to external APIs or datasets for streaming ingestion.

⸻

Step 5 – Simulation & Specialisation
	•	Once loaded, run the SQI Simulation:

/api/aion/sqi/run?container=data_secondary

	•	AION replays datasets, proofs, and models inside the symbolic scaffolding.
	•	This “bootstraps” the system into specialist intelligence in that domain.
	•	Cross-container links create exponential cross-referencing.

⸻

Summary for Operators:
	•	Scaffolding = The empty “mind palace”
	•	Knowledge = The actual “books” on the shelves
	•	Run simulations to wake up the knowledge
	•	Cross-link to make it smarter exponentially

Explanation
	1.	📂 .dc.json Scaffolding
	•	Defines the structure (categories, nodes, links) for a knowledge domain.
	•	Think of it as the empty library shelves labeled and ready.
	2.	📥 Knowledge Upload
	•	You source domain-specific content (physics datasets, math proofs, biology studies, etc.).
	•	Data is prepared in the format the container expects.
	3.	🗂 Container Assembly
	•	Knowledge is placed into the .dc container, each piece going to its matching node.
	•	Provenance, versioning, and schema contracts are enforced.
	4.	🧠 SQI Runtime Loading
	•	Containers are loaded into the SQI engine.
	•	All glyph relations, categories, and metadata become live references.
	5.	🔄 Cross-Referencing Engine
	•	SQI connects knowledge from different containers and domains.
	•	Links, overlaps, and contradictions are identified.
	6.	📈 Exponential Intelligence Growth
	•	Specialisation emerges when one domain is heavily filled.
	•	Generalisation emerges when many domains cross-link.
	7.	🧪 Simulation / Proof Replay
	•	SQI uses the knowledge to run scenario simulations or solve problems.
	•	Example: replaying Lean proofs to internalise logical steps.
	8.	📚 Knowledge Graph Expansion
	•	New derived facts, connections, and summaries are created.
	•	These are added as new nodes or links in the scaffolding.
	9.	📤 Knowledge Export
	•	Cleaned, enhanced, or newly derived knowledge can be exported or re-seeded into new .dc containers.
	•	Cycle restarts with richer knowledge.
