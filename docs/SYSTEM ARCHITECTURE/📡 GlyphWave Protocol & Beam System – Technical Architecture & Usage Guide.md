📡 GlyphWave Protocol & Beam System – Technical Architecture & Usage Guide

⸻

📘 Overview

GlyphWave is the symbolic beam protocol responsible for transmitting symbolic thought, logic waves, and entangled meaning structures across the AION cognition engine, CodexLang runtime, .dc.json containers, SQI system, and GHX/QFC visual overlays.

It serves as both:
	•	A symbolic communication layer (like TCP/IP for symbolic data)
	•	A carrier simulation system that models real-world beam phenomena (optical, quantum, radio, simulated)

This document defines the runtime structure, math foundations, data models, core kernel specs, and usage instructions as of stage P0.

⸻

🧠 Core Purpose

GlyphWave transmits WaveGlyphs — symbolic representations of knowledge, logic, memory, and energy. These glyphs can:
	•	Interfere and entangle with others
	•	Be projected as beams across quantum fields
	•	Encode causal memory into .gip (GlyphWave Interchange Packets)
	•	Travel via different carrier types (light, quantum, etc.)
	•	Trigger replay, collapse, teleportation, or SQI prediction

🌊 GlyphWave System: Technical + User Manual

Phases P0–P4 Complete Build

⸻

📘 Overview

GlyphWave is a symbolic wave execution engine that powers superposition, entanglement, and collapse of symbolic logic glyphs inside the CodexCore + SQI architecture. It provides a quantum-inspired field layer enabling high-fidelity symbolic simulation, container teleportation, beam propagation, and ethical execution through SoulLaw.

Unlike traditional field engines or physics kernels, GlyphWave operates on:
	•	Symbolic WaveGlyphs, not particles
	•	Phase-aware Field Lattices, not discrete state grids
	•	Collapse via SoulLaw, not pure probability
	•	Symbolic Entanglement, not quantum spin

GlyphWave spans 5 key phases (P0–P4) — from foundational math models to live HUD metrics and ethics enforcement.

📘 GlyphWave Phase 6: Testing & Rollout – Technical Documentation

⸻

🧪 P6 – Testing & Rollout Overview

The Testing & Rollout phase ensures GlyphWave’s symbolic wave simulation engine is reliable, performant, safe under extended operation, and well-documented for developers. It includes golden path validation, long-duration soak tests, canary toggles with graceful fallback, and a complete developer onboarding guide.

This phase verifies core symbolic behaviors such as collapse determinism, entanglement integrity, backpressure handling, and feature flag isolation, while also preparing HUD-level debugging and developer-facing documentation.

⸻

✅ G01 – Golden Tests

✅ G01a: Test Collapse Determinism
	•	Purpose: Validates that the symbolic collapse of entangled glyphs yields consistent, reproducible outcomes under identical conditions.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Uses test_collapse_determinism.py to simulate multiple join_waves() invocations on identical input states.
	•	Asserts output glyphs and metadata are stable across runs.
	•	Engine Tested: wave_state.py, interference_kernel_core.py
	•	Why It Matters: Prevents nondeterministic behavior in downstream logic, symbolic prediction, and collapse trails.

⸻

✅ G01b: Test Entangle→Collapse Integrity
	•	Purpose: Ensures that once glyphs are entangled (via entangle_waves()), their joint collapse respects all encoded QGlyph rules and entanglement metadata.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Validates wave states using test_entanglement_integrity.py.
	•	Confirms symbolic dependencies and collapse order match the logical graph state.
	•	Why It Matters: Protects causal consistency across symbolic containers and holographic glyph trails.

⸻

✅ G02 – Soak Tests

✅ G02a: Run Long-Lifecycle Glyphs
	•	Purpose: Simulates long-living waveforms in memory to detect memory leaks, reference errors, or performance drift.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Test loop holds multiple WaveState instances in memory for extended durations.
	•	Periodic assertions check integrity, symbolic decay, and tick-based updates.
	•	Why It Matters: GlyphWave must support continuous operation across agents, sessions, and symbolic lifetimes without degradation.

⸻

✅ G02b: Test Backpressure + Overflow Decay
	•	Purpose: Tests the system’s ability to handle symbolic wave congestion, overflows, and decay fallbacks.
	•	Implementation:
	•	High-frequency wave injections simulate spike load into wave_field.py.
	•	Ensures eviction, collapse, or decay occur without error.
	•	Why It Matters: Critical for preventing symbolic overload during large agent sessions or multiverse collapse chains.

⸻

✅ G03 – Canary + Fallback

✅ G03a: Flip GW_ENABLED only on Hoberman/SEC
	•	Purpose: Activates GlyphWave runtime only on experimental containers (e.g., Hoberman, SEC) for isolated testing.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Uses a container trait check and feature flag (GW_ENABLED) in runtime dispatch.
	•	Automatically routes others to legacy event handling.
	•	Why It Matters: Prevents destabilization of production agents during early GlyphWave rollout.

⸻

✅ G03b: A/B Fallback to Legacy SQI Event Bus
	•	Purpose: Ensures system can gracefully revert to standard SQI event system if GlyphWave fails or is disabled.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Fallback logic in ghx_replay_broadcast.py, container_runtime.py.
	•	Guards for missing beam metadata, HUD replay support, or unsupported wave formats.
	•	Why It Matters: Ensures graceful degradation and uninterrupted symbolic function in production.

⸻

⛓️ Testing Integration Path

All tests in Phase 6 are integrated with:
