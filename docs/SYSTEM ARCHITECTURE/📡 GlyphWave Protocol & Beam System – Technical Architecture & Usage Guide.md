📡 GlyphWave Protocol & Beam System – Technical Architecture & Usage Guide

⸻

📘 Overview

GlyphWave is the symbolic beam protocol responsible for transmitting symbolic thought, logic waves, and entangled meaning structures across the AION cognition engine, CodexLang runtime, .dc.json containers, SQI system, and GHX/QFC visual overlays.

It serves as both:
	•	A symbolic communication layer (like TCP/IP for symbolic data)
	•	A carrier simulation system that models real-world beam phenomena (optical, quantum, radio, simulated)

This document defines the runtime structure, math foundations, data models, core kernel specs, and usage instructions as of stage P0.

⸻

🧠 Core Purpose

GlyphWave transmits WaveGlyphs — symbolic representations of knowledge, logic, memory, and energy. These glyphs can:
	•	Interfere and entangle with others
	•	Be projected as beams across quantum fields
	•	Encode causal memory into .gip (GlyphWave Interchange Packets)
	•	Travel via different carrier types (light, quantum, etc.)
	•	Trigger replay, collapse, teleportation, or SQI prediction

🧰 Kernel Operations

✅ Implemented in interference_kernels.py

interfere(w1, w2) -> WaveState
	•	Adds two waves via complex vector math
	•	Averages coherence
	•	Merges origin trace

entangle([...], mode='bidirectional') -> EntangledWave
	•	Links waves into entangled structure
	•	Tracks bidirectional or fused references

phase_shift(w, delta)
	•	Modifies phase of a wave

join(waves)
	•	Constructs unified WaveState from components

boost(w, factor)
	•	Increases amplitude with coherence adjustment

✅ Kernels are used during:
	•	Beam transmission
	•	Container teleport logic
	•	Entangled memory merges
	•	SQI prediction paths

⸻

🌌 Fields and Lattices

Defined in wave_field_model.py

Each Field represents a spatial map of symbolic waves:
	•	2D or 3D grid structure
	•	Each cell holds a WaveState
	•	Interactions ripple locally (future: diffraction, interference patterns)

🔧 Usage:
	•	GHX replay renderer uses these fields
	•	Wave-based propagation simulations
	•	Predictive field reasoning overlays

⸻

🧩 Feature Flags

To enable GlyphWave across the platform:

export GW_ENABLED=true

In code, this is toggled via:

from backend.modules.glyphwave.feature_flag import gw_enabled

if gw_enabled():
    # Enable beam logic

✔️ Fully integrated into:
	•	ContainerRuntime
	•	Beam overlay systems
	•	Prediction + GHX renderers

📚 Usage Manual (Developer Notes)

✅ How to Emit a Wave:

from glyphwave.core.wave_state import WaveState
from glyphwave.core.wave_state_store import WaveStateStore

store = WaveStateStore()

wave = WaveState(
    id="W123",
    phase=0.5,
    amplitude=1.2,
    coherence=0.95,
    origin_trace=["codex", "container_abc"],
    timestamp=time.time()
)

store.add_wave(wave)

✅ How to Interfere Two Waves:

from glyphwave.kernels.interference_kernels import interfere

merged = interfere(w1, w2)

✅ How to Entangle a Set:

from glyphwave.kernels.interference_kernels import entangle

ent = entangle([w1, w2, w3], mode="fused")


from glyphwave.kernels.interference_kernels import entangle

ent = entangle([w1, w2, w3], mode="fused")
