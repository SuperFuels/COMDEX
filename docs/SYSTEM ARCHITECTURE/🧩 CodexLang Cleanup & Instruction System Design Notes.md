üß© CodexLang Cleanup & Instruction System Design Notes

Last updated: 2025-09-29

This document summarizes the current state of CodexLang instruction cleanup, canonicalization, and rewrite pipeline.
It is intended as a reference for why certain changes were made, where the main registries live, and how the system stays consistent.

‚úÖ Core Components

1. Canonical Ops Registry
	‚Ä¢	File: backend/modules/codex/canonical_ops.py
	‚Ä¢	What: Maps raw glyph symbols (‚äï, ‚àá, ‚ü≤) to canonical, domain-tagged keys (logic:‚äï, math:‚àá, control:‚ü≤).
	‚Ä¢	Why:
	‚Ä¢	Removes symbol collisions (e.g. ‚äó exists in logic, physics, and symatics).
	‚Ä¢	Ensures all downstream systems (executor, translators, docs) speak the same ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù language.
	‚Ä¢	Extra: Also carries OP_METADATA ‚Üí descriptions, categories, symbols for doc generation.

‚∏ª

2. Symatics ‚Üí Codex Rewriter
	‚Ä¢	File: backend/symatics/symatics_to_codex_rewriter.py
	‚Ä¢	What: Translates Symatics-specific operators into CodexLang canonical form.
	‚Ä¢	Why: Symatics introduced its own ops (cancel, damping, resonance, ‚äó_s). These need to be unified with the Codex pipeline without forking execution logic.
	‚Ä¢	Notes: Currently a stub ‚Üí can be extended with explicit rewrite rules.

3. CodexLang Rewriter
	‚Ä¢	File: backend/modules/codex/codexlang_rewriter.py
	‚Ä¢	What: Canonicalizes any instruction tree ops into their domain-tagged equivalents using the registry.
	‚Ä¢	Why: Ensures no raw ‚äï or ‚àá sneak into execution ‚Äî only logic:‚äï, math:‚àá, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Test Hook: Can be monkeypatched in unit tests to verify rewrite flow.

4. Instruction Metadata Bridge
	‚Ä¢	File: backend/modules/codex/canonical_ops.py (with OP_METADATA)
	‚Ä¢	What: Central place where operator descriptions, categories, and symbols live.
	‚Ä¢	Why:
	‚Ä¢	Provides one source of truth for documentation.
	‚Ä¢	Avoids drift between docs, executor, and symbolic engines.
	‚Ä¢	Usage: Consumed by auto-doc builder.

‚∏ª

5. Instruction Reference Builder
	‚Ä¢	File: docs/CodexLang_Instruction/instruction_reference_builder.py
	‚Ä¢	What: Generates instruction_reference.md from OP_METADATA.
	‚Ä¢	Why: Auto-docs avoid manual drift and make operator set transparent.
	‚Ä¢	Command:


PYTHONPATH=. python docs/CodexLang_Instruction/instruction_reference_builder.py

	‚Ä¢	Output: docs/CodexLang_Instruction/instruction_reference.md

‚∏ª

6. CodexExecutor Pipeline (Updated)
	‚Ä¢	File: backend/modules/codex/codex_executor.py
	‚Ä¢	Changes Made:
	‚Ä¢	Added rewrite stage (symatics ‚Üí codex, then canonicalization) before validation.
	‚Ä¢	Added test_mode=True flag to allow unit tests to stop after rewrite (no heavy validation).
	‚Ä¢	Why:
	‚Ä¢	Ensures all execution paths run on canonical keys.
	‚Ä¢	Keeps unit tests lightweight and focused.

‚∏ª

7. Integration & Tests
	‚Ä¢	Key Tests:
	‚Ä¢	backend/modules/tests/test_executor_rewrites_ops.py ‚Üí verifies executor rewrite stage.
	‚Ä¢	backend/modules/tests/test_executor_pipeline.py ‚Üí verifies end-to-end pipeline (glyph ‚Üí translator ‚Üí executor).
	‚Ä¢	Why: Protects against regressions (e.g. skipping canonicalization).
	‚Ä¢	Notes: Tests rely on monkeypatching CodexLangRewriter.canonicalize_ops to confirm call path.

‚∏ª

üö¶ Current Workflow
	1.	Glyph enters executor ‚Üí may be raw (‚äï) or domain-tagged.
	2.	Symatics Rewriter translates Symatics ops if applicable.
	3.	CodexLang Rewriter enforces canonical domain keys (logic:‚äï).
	4.	Validation checks theorem/logic completeness (skipped if test_mode).
	5.	Execution handled by CodexExecutor / downstream engines.
	6.	Docs always synced with operator registry (OP_METADATA).

‚∏ª

üìå Why This Matters
	‚Ä¢	Prevents operator collisions (‚äó across multiple domains).
	‚Ä¢	Establishes a single registry for all operator metadata.
	‚Ä¢	Enables auto-docs and tests that guard rewrite behavior.
	‚Ä¢	Provides a clean onramp for new domains (just update canonical_ops.py and regenerate docs).

üìç Where to Look (Cheat Sheet)
	‚Ä¢	Canonical registry: backend/modules/codex/canonical_ops.py
	‚Ä¢	Rewriters:
	‚Ä¢	Symatics ‚Üí Codex: backend/symatics/symatics_to_codex_rewriter.py
	‚Ä¢	Canonicalizer: backend/modules/codex/codexlang_rewriter.py
	‚Ä¢	Executor: backend/modules/codex/codex_executor.py
	‚Ä¢	Docs:
	‚Ä¢	Builder: docs/CodexLang_Instruction/instruction_reference_builder.py
	‚Ä¢	Output: docs/CodexLang_Instruction/instruction_reference.md
	‚Ä¢	Tests: backend/modules/tests/test_executor_*


‚öñÔ∏è Collision Resolution Overview

Most CodexLang symbols are unique to their domain and map directly to a canonical operator (e.g., ¬¨, ‚àß, ‚à®, H, ‚ü®œà|, œà‚ü©, cancel, resonance).
These do not require disambiguation and pass straight through the translator.

Only a handful of ‚Äútroublemaker‚Äù symbols appear in multiple domains and need the collision resolver:


Symbol										Possible Domains								Notes
‚äó											logic, physics, symatics						Tensor / product ambiguity
‚äï											logic, quantum									XOR-like vs quantum addition
‚Üî											logic, quantum									Equivalence vs quantum bidirection
‚àá											math (reserved for expansion)					May overlap in future domains
‚âà / ~										photon											Aliased forms of wave equivalence



The resolver works as a safety net:
	‚Ä¢	If the symbol is explicitly tagged (e.g., ‚äó_p ‚Üí physics:‚äó), no guessing is needed.
	‚Ä¢	If the symbol is bare/ambiguous (e.g., just ‚äó), the resolver applies priority rules to pick the most likely domain.

üëâ This way, you only pay the cost of collision resolution for these few special cases.
üëâ Everything else stays simple and direct.
