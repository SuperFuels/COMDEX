Stage D ‚Äì Technical Document

Domain Knowledge Graph Loader
COMDEX / AION ‚Äì Knowledge Graph Integration Layer

‚∏ª

1. Overview

Stage D implements the Domain Knowledge Graph Loader ‚Äî a subsystem for importing structured domain-specific knowledge into AION‚Äôs live .dc.json containers.
It provides:
	‚Ä¢	Static seed packs: curated glyph-node/edge datasets for a given discipline.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic merging: attaches loaded nodes/edges into existing container knowledge graphs without downtime.
	‚Ä¢	Multi-pack chaining: supports loading multiple knowledge domains into the same runtime for cross-disciplinary reasoning.

Stage D operates as a bridge between the container runtime and the KnowledgeGraphWriter core module.

‚∏ª

2. Goals
	‚Ä¢	Rapid domain injection: instantly augment a container‚Äôs KG with canonical knowledge.
	‚Ä¢	Isolation: load packs into staging containers without affecting production.
	‚Ä¢	Reusability: packs can be saved/exported for later replay.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-domain synthesis: merge multiple packs into a shared graph for SQI and IGI tasks.

‚∏ª

3. Architecture

3.1 Components
	‚Ä¢	knowledge_graph_writer.py ‚Äì core writer API for adding glyph nodes and edges into containers.
	‚Ä¢	Domain Pack Store ‚Äì repository of .dc.json files containing domain KG seeds.
	‚Ä¢	Container Runtime Interface ‚Äì hooks in container_runtime.py for live container injection.
	‚Ä¢	Verification Layer ‚Äì ensures loaded packs conform to KG schema (node, edge, metadata structure).

‚∏ª

3.2 Data Flow

    DP[Domain Pack Store<br>(.dc.json)] --> L[Stage D Loader]
    L --> KGW[KnowledgeGraphWriter]
    KGW --> CR[Container Runtime]
    CR --> KG[Live Knowledge Graph]

	1.	Domain Pack Load ‚Üí Select .dc.json file from pack store.
	2.	Loader (Stage D) parses and validates the file.
	3.	KnowledgeGraphWriter attaches nodes and edges to target container.
	4.	Container Runtime merges the new data into the live KG for immediate use.

‚∏ª

4. Data Specification

4.1 Node Schema

{
  "type": "kg_node",
  "id": "kg_physics_001",
  "label": "Newton's First Law",
  "glyph": "‚öñÔ∏è",
  "metadata": {
    "domain": "physics",
    "tags": ["law", "mechanics"],
    "source": "seed_pack_physics_v1"
  }
}
4.2 Edge Schema
{
  "type": "kg_edge",
  "from": "kg_physics_001",
  "to": "kg_physics_002",
  "relation": "causes",
  "metadata": {
    "domain": "physics",
    "weight": 0.9
  }
}

5. Runtime Integration

Stage D integrates into the container runtime via:
	‚Ä¢	attach_container() ‚Äì binds KnowledgeGraphWriter to an active container instance.
	‚Ä¢	load_domain_pack(pack_name, container) ‚Äì loads and merges a specific pack.
	‚Ä¢	export_pack(container) ‚Äì exports the current KG as a .dc.json file.

These hooks are safe for live containers and can be invoked during runtime without restart.

‚∏ª

6. API

6.1 Load Pack

from backend.modules.knowledge_graph.knowledge_graph_writer import kg_writer
container = ucs_runtime.get_container("physics_core")
kg_writer.attach_container(container)
kg_writer.load_domain_pack("physics_core", container)

6.2 List Available Packs

kg_writer.list_available_packs()

6.3 Export Current KG
kg_writer.export_pack(container, "exported_pack.json")

7. Validation & Error Handling
	‚Ä¢	Pack Missing ‚Üí raises PackNotFoundError if the pack name is not in store.
	‚Ä¢	Schema Mismatch ‚Üí invalid nodes/edges are skipped and logged.
	‚Ä¢	Duplicate IDs ‚Üí merged with existing node metadata rather than replaced (configurable).

‚∏ª

8. Performance Considerations
	‚Ä¢	Small, targeted packs load faster and cause less reasoning overhead.
	‚Ä¢	Merging many large packs can slow GHX visualization and symbolic reasoning.
	‚Ä¢	Consider pre-merging packs offline for high-load environments.

‚∏ª

9. Security / SoulLaw
	‚Ä¢	Packs may be SoulLaw-locked to prevent unverified or unethical knowledge injection.
	‚Ä¢	Loader validates pack signatures before merging into production containers.
	‚Ä¢	Unauthorized packs are rejected with an audit log entry.

‚∏ª

10. Future Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Softmax readout head for prioritizing which nodes to surface after a load.
	‚Ä¢	Predictive glyph injection for domain forecasting.
	‚Ä¢	Versioned pack management for incremental updates.
	‚Ä¢	Live .dc.json streaming for dynamic knowledge feeds.

‚∏ª

This keeps the style and depth consistent with Stage C‚Äôs tech doc, while fully capturing Stage D‚Äôs scope and API surface.

If you want, I can also prepare a runtime sequence diagram showing exactly how a .dc.json is pulled from disk and merged into the Knowledge Graph during Stage D‚Äôs operation ‚Äî it‚Äôll make the live injection flow much clearer for devs.


Stage D ‚Äì Engineering Guide

Domain Knowledge Graph Loader
COMDEX / AION ‚Äì Knowledge Graph Integration Layer

‚∏ª

Purpose

Stage D equips AION with the ability to load structured domain knowledge directly into live .dc.json containers.
It‚Äôs the ‚Äúknowledge hot-swap‚Äù system ‚Äî enabling rapid expansion of reasoning capacity without rebooting the runtime.

This is where we inject curated knowledge packs (Physics, Biology, Mathematics, etc.) and merge them with the live Knowledge Graph used for SQI, IGI, and prediction tasks.

‚∏ª

Key Capabilities
	‚Ä¢	üì¶ Load & Merge Packs ‚Äì Import .dc.json domain seeds into any container at runtime.
	‚Ä¢	üîó Cross-Domain Merge ‚Äì Load multiple packs for interdisciplinary reasoning.
	‚Ä¢	üß† Schema Validation ‚Äì Enforce correct node/edge structures before merging.
	‚Ä¢	‚è±Ô∏è Zero Downtime ‚Äì Works on live containers without stopping execution.
	‚Ä¢	üîí SoulLaw Validation ‚Äì Rejects or locks unsafe or unverified packs.

‚∏ª

When to Use
	‚Ä¢	Bootstrapping a new container with a baseline knowledge set.
	‚Ä¢	Expanding an existing container into a new domain.
	‚Ä¢	Testing reasoning performance across multiple merged disciplines.
	‚Ä¢	Restoring knowledge after container reset or collapse.

‚∏ª

Workflow for Engineers

1. Locate Your Pack

Packs are .dc.json files in the Domain Pack Store.
Example:

/packs/seed_pack_physics_v1.dc.json
/packs/seed_pack_biology_v1.dc.json
2. Attach Writer to Container

from backend.modules.knowledge_graph.knowledge_graph_writer import kg_writer
container = ucs_runtime.get_container("physics_core")
kg_writer.attach_container(container)

3. Load the Pack

kg_writer.load_domain_pack("physics_core", container)
	‚Ä¢	Loader validates the schema.
	‚Ä¢	If SoulLaw-locked, key verification is triggered.
	‚Ä¢	Nodes and edges are injected directly into the container‚Äôs Knowledge Graph.

‚∏ª

4. Verify Merge

container.graph.summary()

	‚Ä¢	Check that the domain nodes and edges appear.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm relation counts and metadata tags.

‚∏ª

5. (Optional) Export Updated KG

kg_writer.export_pack(container, "physics_plus_biology.dc.json")

This allows saving the current KG (with merged packs) for backup or deployment elsewhere.

‚∏ª

File & Data Standards

Node


Failure Modes & Troubleshooting

Symptom								Likely Cause					Fix
Pack not found
Wrong name/path
Run kg_writer.list_available_packs()
Pack loads but no new nodes appear
Schema mismatch
Run kg_writer.validate_pack(path) before load
Load fails with security error
SoulLaw key missing
Obtain correct key or disable secure mode in dev
Runtime slows after merge
Pack too large
Pre-merge offline, reduce node count
‚∏ª

Maintenance Tips
	‚Ä¢	Keep a versioned pack store to track changes between updates.
	‚Ä¢	Write a unit test for each pack to verify structure before committing to repo.
	‚Ä¢	Regularly prune unused or outdated packs to keep runtime lean.
