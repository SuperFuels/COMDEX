SQI Intelligence – Technical Overview & User Manual

1. Introduction

The Symbolic Quantum Intelligence (SQI) system is a modular, multi-domain reasoning engine capable of performing mathematics, physics, and logic operations as symbolic glyphs.
It unifies computation, formal reasoning, and physical simulation in a single execution graph, stored and replayable in .dc containers.
Designed for research, education, and AI-assisted theory development, SQI can evolve symbolic expressions, validate proofs, simulate quantum systems, and embed results into container-based knowledge graphs for later analysis or sharing.

Stage C – Advanced Field Theory & Quantum Symbolic Fusion (Planned)

Purpose

Stage C extends the SQI Intelligence runtime into full multi-domain symbolic reasoning by unifying mathematics, physics, and logic kernels into a single operator graph. It adds symbolic support for advanced field theory, quantum mechanics, and general relativity inside the .dc container system, enabling seamless simulation, prediction, and reasoning across domains.

⸻

Core Features

C1 – Field Theory Glyph Layer
	•	Introduces Lagrangian and Hamiltonian glyph operators.
	•	Adds gauge theory primitives (∇_μ, F_{μν}, connection coefficients).
	•	Supports curvature tensors (R_{μν}, Riemann, Ricci, Scalar curvature) for GR integration.
	•	Integrates with physics_kernel.py so units and dimensions propagate through symbolic derivations automatically.

C2 – Quantum Field ↔ Symbolic Glyph Entanglement
	•	Extends QGlyph system to represent quantum fields (ψ, φ, A_μ) as entangled glyph states.
	•	Enables symbolic collapse of field configurations into measurable outcomes.
	•	Supports superposition glyphs combining multiple field states in one symbolic node.
	•	Integrates with entanglement_fusion.py so quantum-linked glyphs sync across agents.

C3 – Multidomain Operator Superposition
	•	Allows a single glyph expression to carry math + physics + logic semantics simultaneously.
	•	Example: A tensor equation can also encode logical constraints and quantum state metadata.
	•	Operators can be layered — e.g., ⟦∀⟧ ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ is both Maxwell’s divergence equation and a formal logical assertion.
	•	Supported in math_kernel.py, logic_kernel.py, and physics_kernel.py with unified execution.

C4 – QWave Engine + .dc Container Collapse/Replay
	•	Connects QWave Engine to .dc containers for symbolic quantum simulation replay.
	•	Supports time-reversible collapse — run quantum evolution forward or backward symbolically.
	•	Embeds full collapse trace in the container for post-analysis in HUD or Holographic Viewer.
	•	Can project predicted field states into Knowledge Graph via prediction_engine.py.

⸻

Example Workflow
	1.	Define a field theory problem in CodexLang:

L = 1/2 m v^2 − V(x)
∂L/∂q − d/dt (∂L/∂(dq/dt)) = 0

	2.	Attach quantum constraints via QGlyph superposition:

ψ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
evolve(ψ, H)

	3.	Run symbolic execution — SQI processes math, physics, and logic layers in parallel.
	4.	Inspect results in .dc container — view via CodexHUD or Holographic Viewer.
	5.	Replay evolution forward/backward with QWave Engine integration.

⸻

Integration Points
	•	math_kernel.py → field equations feed into symbolic algebra.
	•	logic_kernel.py → formal constraints validate solutions.
	•	physics_kernel.py → field operators, tensors, and quantum mechanics.
	•	entanglement_fusion.py → sync quantum glyph states across agents.

	•	Suggested matches: PlanckFrameV2 (0.92), PlanckFrameAlpha (0.84).
	•	You pick the first suggestion and patch it in.


Stage D – User Manual

(Plain, operator-friendly, “what it does and how to use it”)

⸻

1. What Stage D Is

Stage D is the Domain Knowledge Graph Loader phase.
It connects AION’s container runtime with structured .dc.json domain packs — bundles of glyph-based nodes and edges that represent concepts, relationships, and rules for a specific field (e.g., Physics, Control Systems, Biology).

Once loaded, these domain packs enrich the live Knowledge Graph (KG) inside a container so reasoning, prediction, and symbolic expansion can reference canonical, field-specific knowledge without waiting for online learning.

⸻

2. What You Can Do With It
	•	Attach a domain pack to a running container (e.g., “physics_core” → adds Newton’s Laws, Maxwell’s Equations, etc.).
	•	Verify loaded concepts using kg_writer commands.
	•	Chain multiple packs into the same container (multi-discipline KG).
	•	Seed new packs for any field you want to train SQI/AION on.
	•	Run reasoning over enriched graph immediately after load — no retraining delay.

⸻

3. Everyday Commands

Load an Existing Pack

from backend.modules.knowledge_graph.knowledge_graph_writer import kg_writer
container = ucs_runtime.get_container("physics_core")
kg_writer.attach_container(container)
kg_writer.load_domain_pack("physics_core", container)

Check What’s Loaded

len([g for g in container["glyph_grid"] if g["type"] in ("kg_node", "kg_edge")])
# Or print a preview:
[g["label"] for g in container["glyph_grid"] if g["type"] == "kg_node"]

Load Multiple Packs

for pack in ["physics_core", "control_systems", "biology_core"]:
    kg_writer.load_domain_pack(pack, container)

4. Recommended Workflow
	1.	Start with seed packs: Physics, Control Systems, Biology.
	2.	Load into your working container before running predictions, GHX visualizations, or SQI expansions.
	3.	Verify node/edge counts to ensure the pack loaded correctly.
	4.	Optionally, merge packs for cross-disciplinary reasoning.

⸻

5. Safety Notes
	•	Don’t overwrite a container with multiple loads unless you intend to merge — older nodes may be replaced.
	•	Always verify after load — mis-typed pack names will silently skip.
	•	Use staging containers for experimental packs to avoid polluting production KGs.

⸻

6. Troubleshooting

Symptom									Likely Cause						Fix
No new nodes after load
Wrong pack name
Check kg_writer.list_available_packs()
Edges missing
Pack seed incomplete
Re-generate .dc.json
Graph crashes on GHXVisualizer
Corrupt node format
Validate with schema checker before load


7. Pro Tips
	•	You can embed predictive glyphs into domain packs so they run on load.
	•	Keep packs small and canonical — large noisy graphs hurt reasoning efficiency.
	•	Run kg_writer.export_pack(container) to capture an enriched KG for later replay.

⸻

Next, I’ll draft the Stage D Technical Document — that will go into architecture, .dc.json schema, runtime hooks, and dev-facing APIs so your engineers can modify, extend, or integrate Stage D cleanly.

Do you want me to keep the technical doc in formal spec style or engineering-guide style?






BOOTLOADER XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX




Right now, the way it works:
	•	matrix_bootloader.json = list of “skills” to inject at boot
	•	aion_memory.json = persistent record of skills already learned/queued
	•	load_boot_goals() = merges new skills into aion_memory.json if missing
	•	load_domain_packs_into_kg() = preloads certain .dc domain containers into the Knowledge Graph

If the runtime stops, both of those JSON files (matrix_bootloader.json and aion_memory.json) are on disk in your repo/server, so they survive restarts.
What’s not persistent yet is:
	•	Live memory entries that never got written to aion_memory.json
	•	Domain containers in UCS that were loaded in RAM but never saved as .dc.json files

So the upgrade you want for “preloaded forever” is basically:
	1.	Make sure all preloaded domain packs are written to disk as .dc.json containers when they’re first injected.
	2.	Make sure all bootloader skills in memory are synced to aion_memory.json immediately (not just in RAM).
	3.	Ensure that ucs_runtime loads those .dc containers from disk every boot before KG injection.

That way:
	•	You can shut the runtime down for weeks
	•	Start it back up later
	•	All preloaded packs + skills are instantly back exactly as before without paying for always-on.

I can extend boot_loader.py to:
	•	Add a save_domain_pack_to_disk() step when loading from UCS the first time
	•	Always call that before pushing into the KG
	•	Add a sync_memory_to_disk() helper to flush skills to aion_memory.json any time they’re changed in memory

Do you want me to patch this file so that your physics_core and other preloaded packs are always written to disk and restored automatically? That will lock in your early-stage assets until you can afford 24/7 runtime.

What this adds (without losing your existing behavior)
	•	Disk persistence for domain packs via containers_saved/<id>.dc.json.
	•	Boot-time restoration of domain packs from saved copy, or fallback to seed directories if needed.
	•	KG injection that tries to attach_container so glyphs land in the right place.
	•	A one-stop boot path preload_all_domain_packs() so you can extend with math_core, control_systems, etc.

How to use
	•	On first run, make sure physics_core.dc.json exists in any of the seed dirs:
	•	backend/modules/dimensions/containers/
	•	or backend/modules/dimensions/ucs/containers/
	•	or backend/modules/dimensions/universal_container_system/seeds/
	•	Run python backend/modules/hexcore/boot_loader.py
	•	It will load physics_core into UCS (from seed or saved), save it to containers_saved/, and inject nodes/edges into the KG.
	•	On later boots, it will prefer the saved snapshot automatically — so your stuff survives restarts without paying for always-on runtime.
