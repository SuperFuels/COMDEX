Matrix Bootloader & Knowledge Packs

User Manual + Technical Guide

‚∏ª

0) TL;DR ‚Äî What you‚Äôre building
	‚Ä¢	Scaffolds = domain packs (*.dc.json) with nodes + links. They define where knowledge goes and how it connects.
	‚Ä¢	Knowledge = actual content (proof libraries, datasets, models) that populate those nodes.
	‚Ä¢	Bootloader wires it all together: loads domain packs into UCS ‚Üí injects into KG ‚Üí exports snapshots ‚Üí bridges domains with cross_links.
	‚Ä¢	SQI/Tessaris then uses the knowledge: replays proofs, runs simulations, detects drift, writes back results.

To specialize on a real problem, you:
	1.	Drop the right domain packs in the right place.
	2.	Load actual sources (math proofs, physics models, curated datasets).
	3.	Run the bootloader to ingest + export.
	4.	Kick off replay/validation jobs.
	5.	Iterate.

1) Directory map (what goes where)

backend/modules/dimensions/
  containers/                 # ‚úÖ Human-authored seed packs (*.dc.json)
  containers_saved/           # ‚úÖ Snapshots the bootloader saves
    kg_exports/               # ‚úÖ Compact KG exports (for replay / fast reload)
  knowledge_atoms/            # ‚úÖ Big external payloads (proof corpora, large tables)
    math/
    physics/
    econ/

    Other important locations:
	‚Ä¢	Bootloader: backend/modules/hexcore/boot_loader.py
	‚Ä¢	UCS runtime: backend/modules/dimensions/universal_container_system/ucs_runtime.py
	‚Ä¢	KG writer: backend/modules/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph_writer.py
	‚Ä¢	SQI bus (spam guard toggles): backend/modules/sqi/sqi_event_bus.py

‚∏ª

2) Boot commands & flags

Run

PYTHONPATH=. \
AION_SQI_SIM_BROADCAST=0 \
AION_ENABLE_WS_BROADCAST=0 \
AION_LOG_LEVEL=warn \
python -m backend.modules.hexcore.boot_loader

Why the flags?
	‚Ä¢	AION_SQI_SIM_BROADCAST=0 ‚Äî mutes simulated SQI spam.
	‚Ä¢	AION_ENABLE_WS_BROADCAST=0 ‚Äî quiets WebSocket chatter during ingest.
	‚Ä¢	AION_LOG_LEVEL=warn ‚Äî show warnings+errors only.

3) Domain pack format (the scaffold)

Minimal schema for *.dc.json:

{
  "id": "physics_core",
  "name": "Physics Core",
  "type": "dc",
  "symbol": "‚öõÔ∏è",
  "metadata": {
    "domain": "physics",
    "description": "Mechanics, Thermo, EM, QFT resonance",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "glyph_categories": [
    { "id": "mech", "label": "Mechanics", "emoji": "‚öôÔ∏è" }
  ],
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "newton_laws",
      "label": "Newton's Laws",
      "cat": "mech",
      "source": { "tier": "secondary", "ref": "doi:..." }
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    { "src": "newton_laws", "dst": "maxwell_eqs", "relation": "informs" }
  ]
}

Notes
	‚Ä¢	Use id/name consistently. The file name must be <id>.dc.json.
	‚Ä¢	nodes[*].source.tier ‚àà {primary, secondary, tertiary} to encode provenance.
	‚Ä¢	links[*] capture semantic relations (e.g., depends_on, proves, validates, influences).

4) Knowledge sources (the content)

This is where the actual intelligence comes from.

A) Formal math libraries (Lean/Coq/Isabelle)
	‚Ä¢	Export doc JSON (defs/lemmas/theorems + deps).
	‚Ä¢	Store here:
backend/modules/dimensions/knowledge_atoms/math/mathlib_docgen.json
	‚Ä¢	Reference it from a domain pack node, e.g.:

{
  "id": "mathlib_core",
  "label": "Lean mathlib",
  "cat": "library",
  "source": {
    "tier": "primary",
    "ref": "knowledge_atoms/math/mathlib_docgen.json"
  }
}

{
  "id": "mathlib_core",
  "label": "Lean mathlib",
  "cat": "library",
  "source": {
    "tier": "primary",
    "ref": "knowledge_atoms/math/mathlib_docgen.json"
  }
}

B) Physics/Engineering models
	‚Ä¢	Put big model sets (equations, parameter tables) under knowledge_atoms/physics/‚Ä¶
	‚Ä¢	Reference them similarly via source.ref.

C) Data (primary/secondary/tertiary)
	‚Ä¢	You already have data_primary, data_secondary packs.
	‚Ä¢	Drop CSV/Parquet/HDF under knowledge_atoms/<domain>/data/... and reference via nodes.
	‚Ä¢	Link datasets to the theories they validate:

{ "src": "market_ticks", "dst": "efficient_market_hypothesis", "relation": "validates" }

5) Bootloader pipeline (what actually happens)
	1.	Preload containers
	‚Ä¢	Finds containers/<id>.dc.json or containers_saved/<id>.dc.json.
	‚Ä¢	Loads into UCS (so it‚Äôs runtime-visible).
	2.	Persist
	‚Ä¢	Saves the current pack to containers_saved/<id>.dc.json for cold starts.
	3.	Inject into KG
	‚Ä¢	kg_writer.attach_container(container) to keep glyphs scoped.
	‚Ä¢	kg_writer.load_domain_pack(...) or generic _ingest_dc_into_kg fallback creates KG nodes/edges.
	4.	Export compact KG pack
	‚Ä¢	containers_saved/kg_exports/<id>.kg.json (small, fast to reload).
	5.	Bridge last
	‚Ä¢	cross_links.dc.json is applied after all domain packs to stitch them together.

You‚Äôll see logs like:

üß† KG: physics_core domain loaded into Knowledge Graph.
üíæ KG export saved to .../kg_exports/physics_core.kg.json

6) Cross-domain links (cross_links.dc.json)

Purpose: ensure graph connectivity across domains so reasoning can flow.
You already created a comprehensive file; keep it in containers/ and the bootloader will apply it last.

Tips:
	‚Ä¢	Only link existing node IDs (avoid typos).
	‚Ä¢	Use meaningful relations: derives_from, validates, models, controls, applied_to, influences.

7) From scaffold ‚Üí ‚Äúactually solves problems‚Äù

Step 1: Pick a target problem

Example: Stabilize a plasma (MHD) with minimal actuator power.

Step 2: Ensure required packs exist
	‚Ä¢	physics_core (MHD, EM)
	‚Ä¢	control_systems (LQR/H‚àû/MPC)
	‚Ä¢	engineering_materials (thermal limits, conductivity)
	‚Ä¢	economics_core (cost/trade-offs, decision theory)
	‚Ä¢	data_primary, data_secondary (diagnostic time series + curated features)

Step 3: Load real knowledge
	‚Ä¢	Import proof corpus (functional analysis ‚Üí PDE well-posedness).
	‚Ä¢	Import model packs (MHD equations, device parameters).
	‚Ä¢	Import datasets (sensor timeseries, power logs).

Step 4: Link it
	‚Ä¢	Add edges:
	‚Ä¢	MHD_model -> sobolev_spaces : requires
	‚Ä¢	feature_marts -> mpc : feeds
	‚Ä¢	bode_plot -> power_supply_constraints : respects
	‚Ä¢	market_ticks -> power_price_model : validates

Step 5: Boot
	‚Ä¢	Run the bootloader (with quiet flags).
	‚Ä¢	Verify exports were written to kg_exports.

Step 6: Replay/validate
	‚Ä¢	Run proof replay on the imported math (see ¬ß8).
	‚Ä¢	Run simulation/estimators and write drift reports.
	‚Ä¢	Iterate until drift is low and proofs/constraints are satisfied.

‚∏ª

8) Proof replay & verification (SQI/Tessaris)

You can automate formal verification so the system continuously checks itself.

Ingredients
	‚Ä¢	mathlib_import.py (adapter) ‚Äî reads doc-gen JSON ‚Üí emits KG nodes (axiom/lemma/theorem) + depends_on edges.
	‚Ä¢	run_proof_replay.py ‚Äî walks imported theorems, tries replay (or static confirmation), emits:
	‚Ä¢	proof_state glyphs (status: verified | failed | unknown)
	‚Ä¢	drift_report glyphs on inconsistencies
	‚Ä¢	edges: theorem_X -> dataset_Y : validated_by if you link empirical checks

Where to put

backend/modules/tessaris/mathlib_import.py
backend/modules/tessaris/run_proof_replay.py

Kickoff

PYTHONPATH=. AION_LOG_LEVEL=info python -m backend.modules.tessaris.mathlib_import \
  --doc-json backend/modules/dimensions/knowledge_atoms/math/mathlib_docgen.json

PYTHONPATH=. AION_LOG_LEVEL=info python -m backend.modules.tessaris.run_proof_replay \
  --scope mathlib_core --max 500

  (If you want, I‚Äôll hand you ready-to-drop stubs next.)

‚∏ª

9) Data tiers (what each is for)
	‚Ä¢	Primary: unprocessed reality (sensors, logs, raw lab data).
	‚Ä¢	Secondary: cleaned/curated/feature-engineered; model-ready.
	‚Ä¢	Tertiary: derivative artifacts (benchmarks, reports, dashboards), often many-to-one summaries.

Link them
	‚Ä¢	Primary ‚Üí Secondary: "relation": "promoted_to" | "transforms_to"
	‚Ä¢	Secondary ‚Üí Model nodes: "feeds"
	‚Ä¢	Tertiary ‚Üí Theorems/Policies: "summarizes" | "supports" | "explains"

10) Observability & hygiene
	‚Ä¢	Spam control
	‚Ä¢	AION_SQI_SIM_BROADCAST=0
	‚Ä¢	AION_ENABLE_WS_BROADCAST=0
	‚Ä¢	AION_LOG_LEVEL=warn
	‚Ä¢	Memory sanitize
	‚Ä¢	Bootloader calls sanitize_memory_file_at(...)‚Äîyou‚Äôll see how many bad rows got dropped.
	‚Ä¢	Exports
	‚Ä¢	After boot you should have JSON in containers_saved/ and kg_exports/.
	‚Ä¢	Inspect with:

    jq '.nodes | length' backend/modules/dimensions/containers_saved/kg_exports/physics_core.kg.json
jq '.links | length' backend/modules/dimensions/containers_saved/kg_exports/physics_core.kg.json

11) Troubleshooting
	‚Ä¢	‚Äúseed not found for ‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Ensure containers/<id>.dc.json exists & id matches filename.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúKG export failed: name ‚ÄòKG_EXPORT_DIR‚Äô is not defined‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Make sure bootloader defines KG_EXPORT_DIR before use.
	‚Ä¢	WS/GPIO spam
	‚Ä¢	Use the env flags above; ensure debouncing is enabled in sqi_event_bus.py.
	‚Ä¢	UCSGeometryLoader.register_geometry() missing ... 'description'
	‚Ä¢	If your cross_links is treated as a geometry, add "description" or ensure it loads as a normal DC container (not a geometry). Keep it in containers/, not the geometry registry.
	‚Ä¢	jq: Cannot index array with string "links"
	‚Ä¢	You probably piped the raw nodes array into .links. Run jq '.nodes|length, .links|length' file.json from root of the JSON, not inside a sub-array.

‚∏ª

12) Versioning & persistence
	‚Ä¢	Boot saves canonical snapshots to containers_saved/.
	‚Ä¢	KG exports are compact‚Äîprefer these for quick cold starts.
	‚Ä¢	Keep IDs stable; links depend on exact node IDs.
	‚Ä¢	For huge payloads, put content in knowledge_atoms/ and reference it from domain packs (don‚Äôt inline massive data).

‚∏ª

13) Security & ethics
	‚Ä¢	The system emits SoulLaw approvals/violations as glyphs.
	‚Ä¢	If you integrate external actions (actuators, trading), put risk guards into the KG (e.g., policy_node -> action_node : governs) and enforce checks before execution.

‚∏ª

14) Typical ‚Äúspecialize me‚Äù workflow (checklist)
	1.	Create/extend domain packs needed by your problem.
	2.	Put actual knowledge under knowledge_atoms/ (proofs, models, data).
	3.	Reference those files in domain nodes via source.ref.
	4.	Write cross links that connect the domains.
	5.	Run bootloader (quiet flags).
	6.	Verify exports in kg_exports/.
	7.	Run mathlib_import (if using formal libraries).
	8.	Run run_proof_replay (batch).
	9.	Attach datasets ‚Üí write validation edges.
	10.	Iterate: fix drift, add missing theorems, refine features, re-run.

15) FAQ

Q: Isn‚Äôt this just metadata?
A: The domain packs are scaffolds. The knowledge is the referenced content (proof corpora, models, data) + the derived glyphs SQI/Tessaris produce during replay/validation.

Q: When does it become ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù?
A: When the graph is dense enough‚Äîmath ‚Üî models ‚Üî data ‚Üî proofs ‚Üî policies‚Äîand replay/validation loops keep it consistent. Cross-links make inferences propagate.

Q: What do I upload exactly?
A: For math: doc-gen JSON; for physics/engineering: model specs/equations/params; for data: raw CSV/Parquet/HDF; for curation: feature definitions & splits. Reference them via source.ref.
