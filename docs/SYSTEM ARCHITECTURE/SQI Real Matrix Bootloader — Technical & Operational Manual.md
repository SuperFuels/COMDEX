Real Matrix Bootloader — Technical & Operational Manual

This is your blueprint for turning .dc.json scaffolding into a specialized, self-improving AION that cross-links knowledge and compounds intelligence over time.

⸻

1) What this system does (in one breath)
	•	You seed domain scaffolds (*.dc.json) → AION loads them → SQI & KG cross-link nodes → you upload real knowledge (datasets, proofs, texts) mapped to those nodes → AION simulates/replays/derives → writes new knowledge back into the graph → exports durable packs → the loop repeats faster with each pass. Boom: exponential learning.

⸻

2) File & directory anatomy (where things live)
	•	Domain seeds (hand-authored scaffolds):
backend/modules/dimensions/containers/*.dc.json
	•	Saved containers (snapshots written by bootloader):
backend/modules/dimensions/containers_saved/*.dc.json
	•	KG exports (replayable KG packs):
backend/modules/dimensions/containers_saved/kg_exports/*.kg.json
	•	Bootloader (orchestrates all of this):
backend/modules/hexcore/boot_loader.py
	•	Knowledge Graph writer (injects nodes/edges/glyphs, exports packs):
backend/modules/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph_writer.py
	•	UCS runtime (where containers get registered/loaded):
backend/modules/dimensions/universal_container_system/ucs_runtime.py
	•	SQI event bus (debounced broadcast; optional):
backend/modules/sqi/sqi_event_bus.py

⸻

3) .dc.json schema (the minimal contract)

Each container is a typed JSON “pack”:


{
  "id": "physics_core",
  "name": "Physics Core",
  "type": "dc",
  "symbol": "⚛️",
  "metadata": {
    "domain": "physics",
    "provenance": "seed|generated|imported",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "glyph_categories": [
    { "id": "em", "label": "Electromagnetism", "emoji": "⚡" }
  ],
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "maxwell_eqs",
      "label": "Maxwell's Equations",
      "cat": "em",
      "type": "kg_node",
      "source": { "tier": "secondary", "ref": "doi:...", "notes": "..." },
      "notes": "arbitrary metadata allowed"
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    { "src": "maxwell_eqs", "dst": "fourier_transform", "relation": "solved_via" }
  ]
}

Notes
	•	id must match the filename (physics_core.dc.json → "id": "physics_core").
	•	nodes[*].id is your canonical node key (prefer stable slugs).
	•	source objects can encode tier (primary/secondary/tertiary), ref (doi/url), optional notes.

4) Bootloader lifecycle (what runs, and in what order)

Command to run (from repo root):

AION_SQI_SIM_BROADCAST=0 AION_LOG_LEVEL=warn \
PYTHONPATH=. python -m backend.modules.hexcore.boot_loader

What happens
	1.	Memory clean: prunes malformed rows in aion_memory.json.
	2.	Seed discovery: finds domain packs (e.g., math_core, physics_core, control_systems, etc.).
	3.	UCS load: ensures each domain pack is registered in the UCS (from saved snapshot or seed).
	4.	KG inject: pushes nodes/edges into the Knowledge Graph (custom handler → generic fallback).
	5.	KG export: writes *.kg.json snapshots under containers_saved/kg_exports/ for replay.
	6.	Cross-links last: loads cross_links.dc.json (bridges across domains at the end).

Env flags
	•	AION_SQI_SIM_BROADCAST=0 quiets simulated bus spam.
	•	AION_LOG_LEVEL=warn reduces logging.
	•	AION_ENABLE_WS_BROADCAST=0 disables websocket emits from KG writer (optional).

⸻

5) Data tiers: Primary / Secondary / Tertiary (and why they matter)
	•	Primary = raw instruments, ELN/LIMS, simulation dumps, machine logs, telemetry.
→ Use data_primary.dc.json to define schemas and provenance for IO-level truth.
	•	Secondary = cleaned/standardized, feature stores, aggregated panels, curated registries.
→ Use data_secondary.dc.json to encode your pipelines (impute, normalize, split).
	•	Tertiary = publications, textbooks, encyclopedias, Wikipedia, glossaries, ontologies.
→ Use data_tertiary.dc.json to reference broad knowledge & high-level connections.

These packs let SQI reason about data lineage and rank evidence by tier.

⸻

6) Filling the scaffolding with real knowledge (the practical playbook)

A) Map your sources to nodes
	•	For physics: datasets → maxwell_eqs, fourier_transform, dirac_field, etc.
	•	For control: proofs & examples → lyapunov_stability, riccati_equation, lqr, etc.
	•	For materials: property tables → steel_1018, al_6061, ceramic_al2o3…

Each node can carry:
	•	source: { "tier": "primary|secondary|tertiary", "ref": "doi/url", "notes": "..." }
	•	domain-specific fields (e.g., E, yield_strength, thermal_conductivity, conductivity, etc.)
	•	optional attachments (store file paths or pointers your ingestion code understands).

B) Import proof libraries (math specialisation)
	•	Mirror or mount Lean mathlib (or your formal proof repo) under a known path.
	•	Create math_core.dc.json nodes like real_analysis, algebra, category_theory, etc., and attach sources:


    { "id": "lean_mathlib", "label": "Lean mathlib", "cat": "proofs",
  "source": { "tier": "secondary", "ref": "https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4" } }

  	•	Use a proof importer (your integration) to:
	•	parse theorem metadata,
	•	link theorems → axioms (edges),
	•	record proof scripts as kg_source or kg_node with "type": "proof_state" entries.

C) Drop curated datasets
	•	Store files alongside the repo (or S3/GCS with signed URLs).
	•	Reference them via source.ref and a data_url/path field in node metadata.
	•	Example:

    { "id": "market_ticks_2022Q1",
  "label": "NASDAQ LOB 2022-Q1",
  "cat": "stream",
  "source": { "tier": "primary", "ref": "s3://bucket/lob_2022q1.parquet" } }

  D) Let the bootloader do the rest
	•	It loads containers, injects into KG, exports kg packs, bridges domains.

⸻

7) Cross-domain links (why cross_links.dc.json exists)
	•	It encodes semantic bridges (e.g., state_space → newton_laws), making reasoning flow across domains.
	•	Keep it lean but consistent: you can grow it as you add more seeds.
	•	Bootloader always applies cross-links last so all targets exist before bridging.

⸻

8) How SQI “understands” the subject (beyond scaffolding)
	1.	Graph structure (your seeds) — what the topics are & how they relate.
	2.	Evidence objects (you upload) — datasets, proofs, curated sources attached to nodes.
	3.	Runtime traces — simulations/proof replays create derived glyphs (drift_report, proof_state, harmonics_suggestions) linked back to sources.
	4.	Debiased broadcast & ingestion — the event bus writes results into the KG with idempotent hashes and relation links.
	5.	Compression & export — everything is exported as replayable KG packs to persist intelligence between boots.

⸻

9) Specialising AION to a domain (step-by-step)
	1.	Author/verify seed: create your_domain.dc.json with nodes/categories/links.
	2.	Attach sources: for each node, add source metadata with tier/ref.
	3.	Place data & proofs: put files where your importers can access them (path or URL).
	4.	Run bootloader:

    AION_SQI_SIM_BROADCAST=0 AION_LOG_LEVEL=warn PYTHONPATH=. \
python -m backend.modules.hexcore.boot_loader

	5.	Check exports: confirm containers_saved/kg_exports/your_domain.kg.json exists.
	6.	Replay/Simulate: run your scenario/proof tools (routes or scripts) to generate new glyphs.
	7.	Inspect GHX/KG: verify new nodes/edges/derived states show up; iterate.

⸻

10) Operational commands & flags
	•	Primary boot

    PYTHONPATH=. python -m backend.modules.hexcore.boot_loader

    	•	Quieter logs

        AION_LOG_LEVEL=warn AION_SQI_SIM_BROADCAST=0 \
PYTHONPATH=. python -m backend.modules.hexcore.boot_loader

	•	Disable WS broadcast entirely (headless)

    AION_ENABLE_WS_BROADCAST=0 PYTHONPATH=. python -m backend.modules.hexcore.boot_loader


⸻

11) Validation & QA (quick checks)
	•	UCS has your container

    ls backend/modules/dimensions/containers/*.dc.json
ls backend/modules/dimensions/containers_saved/*.dc.json

	•	KG pack written

    jq '.id,.nodes|length,.links|length' \
  backend/modules/dimensions/containers_saved/kg_exports/physics_core.kg.json

  	•	Cross-links applied last
Look for a boot log line: Applying cross_links bridging… + a final KG export.

⸻

12) Troubleshooting (fast fixes)
	•	“Domain not found… skipping.”
→ Filename ≠ id. Make sure my_domain.dc.json has "id": "my_domain".
	•	“KG auto-export failed: name ‘…’ not defined”
→ Ensure KG_EXPORT_DIR is defined in both boot loader and knowledge_graph_writer.py (yours is).
	•	Spammy SQI logs
→ Run with AION_SQI_SIM_BROADCAST=0 and AION_LOG_LEVEL=warn.
	•	WS import cycles / event errors
→ Set AION_ENABLE_WS_BROADCAST=0 for batch ingests or CI.
	•	Cross-links load error (geometry signature)
→ Keep cross_links as a normal dc pack (nodes/links), not a geometry registration.

⸻

13) Security & provenance
	•	Always set source.tier correctly, and keep ref resolvable.
	•	For private data, encrypt paths or store only a keyed handle the importer can resolve.
	•	Use versioned seeds (metadata.version) and export KG snapshots per release.

⸻

14) Extending the loop (going from scaffolding → mastery)
	•	Proof engines: ingest Lean/Coq/Isabelle artifacts → proof_state glyphs.
	•	Sim pipelines: attach notebooks or scripts to nodes (e.g., bode_plot) and log drift reports back.
	•	Auto-synthesis: write a small job that proposes new links when 2 nodes co-occur in proofs/datasets.
	•	Curation feedback: promote tidy_tables → golden_datasets when coverage/QA thresholds met (encoded as glyphs).

⸻

15) Example: adding a new domain (end-to-end in 5 steps)
	1.	Create backend/modules/dimensions/containers/astro_core.dc.json with nodes/links and categories.
	2.	Add sources to nodes (primary telescope logs, secondary reductions, tertiary literature).
	3.	Put your FITS/Parquet under a path your importer can use; reference via source.ref.
	4.	Run the bootloader (flags as needed).
	5.	Verify astro_core.kg.json exists; run your sim/proof tasks to produce derived glyphs.

⸻

16) What “done” looks like
	•	All target seeds (math, physics, control, engineering, biology, economics, data_ tiers*, cross_links) present in containers/.
	•	Boot logs show each domain loaded, KG exported, and cross-links applied last.
	•	containers_saved/ contains saved copies of each pack; kg_exports/ contains replayable KG snapshots.
	•	Derived glyphs (proof/drift/harmonics) accumulate over time, and each boot feels smarter than the last.
