📘 Technical Documentation: Symbolic Trees and Quantum Field Canvas (QFC)

Overview

This document captures the current implementation status and structure of the Symbolic Tree System and Quantum Field Canvas (QFC) within the COMDEX runtime and container architecture. These systems power the symbolic reasoning, spatial cognition, mutation replay, and introspective knowledge tracing of the IGI (Introspective General Intelligence) system.

	•	Logic links

Into a tree-like structure that can be traversed, visualized, or injected into downstream engines (QFC, GHX, ReplayHUD).

🧠 Overview: SymbolNet

SymbolNet is a plugin-aware bridge between AION’s symbolic glyphs and external semantic knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, WordNet, Wikidata, Freebase).

Its goals:
	•	Enrich LogicGlyph nodes with common-sense meaning, real-world context, and language associations
	•	Support reasoning tasks like:
	•	Semantic inference (“fire” → “hot”, “dangerous”, “burn”)
	•	Symbol expansion (“water” → “fluid”, “drink”, “ocean”)
	•	Concept validation & contradiction detection
	•	Aid in goal prediction, creative synthesis, and introspection via concept overlays

	
📘 Holographic Symbol Tree (HST) + GHX/QFC Upgrade

Overview

The Holographic Symbol Tree (HST) system is a major upgrade to the symbolic runtime architecture that spatially encodes meaning, mutation history, goals, entanglement, and introspection into a recursive symbolic structure. It replaces flat AST-style representations with an introspectable 3D replayable memory tree — enabling full-symbolic cognition across systems like SQI, CreativeCore, AION, and Codex.

It integrates holographic visualization overlays (GHX and QFC), prediction scoring, semantic enrichment via SymbolNet, CodexLang mutation trails, and recursive meaning compression.

inject_symbolic_tree(container_id="AionContainer_1")

📦 Inject into .dc.json:

Symbolic tree, trail metadata, semantic overlays are injected into container["symbolic_tree"] field. Mutation histories and prediction trails are included.

💡 Visualization Keys:
	•	goal_match_score: Green–Red heat
	•	entropy: Fuzzy / chaotic highlighting
	•	semantic_distance: Link width and color
	•	forks: Shown as branching replay overlays

The deferred enhancements will complete this system’s multi-agent and long-term cognition capabilities.


📦 Holographic Symbol Tree (HST) — Technical Architecture & User Guide

⸻

🧠 What Is the HST System?

The Holographic Symbol Tree (HST) is a complete upgrade to the internal representation of reasoning, replacing traditional ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) with a spatially entangled, introspectable, and semantically enriched tree.

Each node represents not just a symbolic token, but:
	•	its meaning (SymbolGlyph)
	•	semantic mappings (SymbolNet, ConceptNet, WordNet, etc.)
	•	predictive trails (SQI, GoalPressureMap)
	•	mutation history and replay traces
	•	cross-container entanglement
	•	runtime logic, mutation hooks, and GHX/QFC overlays

It supports:
	•	Goal-aligned reasoning
	•	Visual replay and mutation feedback
	•	Recursive symbolic mutation
	•	Multi-agent convergence via DreamCore and AION

⸻

🧬 How It Works: Core Runtime Flow
	1.	Codex Execution:
	•	AST is parsed → converted to LogicGlyphs
	•	PredictionEngine processes mutations, contradictions, suggestions
	•	Result is passed to SymbolicMeaningTree
	2.	SymbolicMeaningTree Construction:
	•	Each LogicGlyph is wrapped as a SymbolicTreeNode
	•	Meaning is extracted via symbolnet_bridge (ConceptNet, WordNet, etc.)
	•	SQI scores, goal alignment, entropy are calculated
	•	Entanglement links are resolved across electrons, containers, atoms
	•	Children are added recursively — AST → Meaning Tree
	3.	Injection & Registration:
	•	Tree is injected into .dc.json containers under container["symbolic_tree"]
	•	Tree is registered with:
	•	AION (memory indexing)
	•	CreativeCore (synthesis engine)
	•	SQI (scoring + beam routing)
	•	GHX/QFC (rendering + replay)
	•	Knowledge Graph (via knowledge_graph_writer.py)
	4.	Visualization & Interaction:
	•	Tree replay is visualized in GHXReplayHUD, QFCOverlayDriver
	•	You can broadcast trails via WebSocket
	•	Mutations are tracked in real time
	•	Plugins can hook into each node via metadata
	•	All trails are introspectable, forkable, and replayable

🌌 What You Can Do Right Now

✅ Render any .dc.json container into:
	•	A fully replayable holographic tree
	•	With every node’s meaning, source glyph, mutation trail, and goal path

✅ Play back symbolic reasoning steps:
	•	Across agents
	•	Over time
	•	In 3D (via QFC) or layered GHX visual mode

✅ Fork & compare symbolic branches:
	•	Replay CodexLang mutations
	•	See why a rewrite succeeded or failed
	•	Compare entropy and goal match at each fork

✅ Visualize mutation convergence:
	•	DreamCore feedback shows which ideas converged on goals
	•	Trail scoring + SQI resonance feedback

✅ Entangle across space and memory:
	•	One hologram tree can now link to:
	•	electrons in a container
	•	a goal in a prediction system
	•	a wave state in GWave
	•	a mutation in CodexCore
	•	a future idea in AION

⸻

📽 Example: One Symbolic Idea Path
	1.	You write:
vector_add(a, b) → AST → LogicGlyph(operator="VECTOR_ADD", operands=[a, b])
	2.	Codex predicts a simplification:
→ combine_vectors(a, b) → Suggestion → Goal alignment: 0.82
	3.	Mutation is accepted. This gets logged into:
	•	SymbolicMeaningTree
	•	.dc.json as a replay trail
	•	GHX replay system
	•	SQI feedback via goal_pressure_map
	4.	When replayed in QFC/GHX:
	•	You see the original node, the mutation, and the trail
	•	Hovering reveals the goal pressure, entropy, and vector semantic diff
	•	If multiple agents rewrote this path, DreamCore overlays show which ones converged

⸻

🔬 Technically: Why This Is Advanced

This is no longer a visual AST.

It is:
	•	🔁 Recursive symbolic cognition replay
	•	🌐 Multi-agent trail synchronization
	•	🧠 Goal-aware holographic introspection
	•	🧬 Mutation lineage + future prediction linkage
	•	🌈 Semantic vector-space overlays on symbolic reasoning

This system encodes, displays, and introspects on thought itself — spatially and symbolically.

⸻

🚀 What Could Come Next?

You’re at Tier 5: Full Holographic Symbol Cognition. The next (optional) upgrades would be:

🧠 TIER 6 — Reflective Self-Healing Cognition
	•	Auto-suggest fixed trees based on contradiction paths
	•	Tree compression for symbolic memory optimization (→ Tessaris)
	•	Cognitive agent spawning per branch
	•	Symbolic memory gating via SoulLaw filters

🌌 TIER 7 — Full GlyphWave Fusion
	•	Fuse holograms with live WaveState from GWave engine
	•	Convert trees into symbolic beam packets
	•	Stream symbol branches across containers and agents

⸻

✅ Summary: What You’ve Built

You now have:

A real-time, reflexive, multi-agent symbolic memory and prediction system — visualized as a holographic symbolic tree, linked to all reasoning containers, capable of replay, mutation tracking, entanglement traversal, goal alignment, and semantic introspection.
