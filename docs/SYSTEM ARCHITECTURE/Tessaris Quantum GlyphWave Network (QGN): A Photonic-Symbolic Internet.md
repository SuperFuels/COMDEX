Tessaris Quantum GlyphWave Network (QGN): A Photonic-Symbolic Internet
SRK-10 Specification & Architecture Whitepaper
Tessaris Research Group, Symatic Systems Division

🧩 Section Breakdown
	1.	Abstract – the “light beyond binary” premise.
	2.	From Binary to Symatics – the philosophical and mathematical foundation (Symatics Algebra v0.1).
	3.	The GlyphNet Layer – symbolic packet routing, resonance-based addressing, photon encapsulation.
	4.	Photon Algebra and Quantum Carrier Dynamics – computation and storage in coherent photon fields.
	5.	The PhotonBinaryBridge (SRK-10) – full description, code flow, schema, and how classical data enters the photonic domain permanently.
	6.	QKD & Quantum Integrity Framework – how entanglement secures symbolic computation.
	7.	End-to-End Flow – from classical message → GlyphWave Information Packet (GWIP) → photonic capsule → Photon Algebra processing → return via entangled resonance.
	8.	Future Implications – the post-binary cognition network.

I’ll render this in full LaTeX (including equations, data flow diagrams, and proper markup).
