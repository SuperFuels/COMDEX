🧠 Symbolic Pattern Engine: Technical Documentation & User Manual

Version: AION-10.0 / SQI Phase 3

⸻

📘 Overview

The Symbolic Pattern Engine is a complete subsystem in AION that detects, mutates, scores, and projects symbolic patterns across containers, holograms, and execution pathways. It provides both backend intelligence (pattern recognition, mutation, SQI feedback) and frontend feedback (GHX overlay, CodexLang commands, real-time UI broadcast).

This document is a handover reference for developers, contributors, and AI agents working with pattern systems in CodexLang, SQI, and the symbolic runtime.

⸻

🧩 Components Overview

🔹 Pattern Representation

Patterns are represented as glyph subtrees or reusable symbolic structures:

{
  "pattern_id": "pat:mirror_logic",
  "glyphs": [ ... ],
  "tags": ["mirror", "symmetry", "logic"]
}

They may appear in:
	•	.dc.json containers
	•	Symbolic Quantum Sheets (SQS)
	•	Live glyph execution traces
	•	GHX scroll overlays

  🧪 Runtime Hooks & Execution Path

Patterns are auto-detected and broadcast when:

✅ 1. Glyph Executed in CodexExecutor

# codex_executor.py
if isinstance(glyph, dict) and glyph.get("glyphs"):
    broadcast_pattern_prediction(glyph)
    auto_trigger_qfc_from_pattern(glyph)
    trigger_emotion_bridge_from_pattern(glyph)

✅ 2. Glyph Broadcast to WebSocket HUD

// frontend/CodexHUD.tsx
onPatternEvent(pattern: PatternPayload) {
  renderOverlay(pattern);
  suggestNextActions(pattern);
}

✅ 3. Injected to KG
# pattern_kg_bridge.py
KnowledgeGraphWriter.inject_pattern(pattern)

✅ 4. Optional: Mutation Engine
# creative_pattern_mutation.py
mutate_pattern(pattern, mode="divergent")

💬 CodexLang Commands

Use symbolic pattern logic directly in CodexLang:

detect_pattern logic_symmetry in current_container
mutate_pattern pat:inverse_loop using divergent
suggest_next_glyphs from pattern pat:mirror
inject_pattern pat:qubit_chain into container:dc_xyz

These are routed via codex_pattern_commands.py.

🔁 Pattern Mutation Modes

Via creative_pattern_mutation.py:
	•	divergent → Branch creative variants
	•	compressive → Simplify pattern core
	•	harmonic → Enforce symmetry + balance
	•	random → Entropic experimentation

⸻

🧠 Emotional Bridge

Patterns can trigger emotion/mutation cascades:

# pattern_emotion_bridge.py
trigger_emotion_bridge_from_pattern(pattern)

Used to:
	•	Influence agent state (mood, tension)
	•	Modify mutation goals
	•	Trigger reflection loops

⸻

📜 Pattern Replay & GHX Overlay
	•	All patterns are trace-logged (pattern_trace_replay.py)
	•	Patterns can be rendered in holographic overlays (GHX)
	•	ghx_pattern_overlay.tsx shows animated match highlights
	•	Replay enables introspection or debugging

⸻

🌐 Multi-Agent Collaboration (CRDT)

In multi-agent scenarios:
	•	Patterns can be edited collaboratively via pattern_crdt_sync.py
	•	Follows symbolic CRDT model (intent-preserving, identity-tracked)
	•	Supports agents editing live .dc.json containers in shared context

🛠 Developer Tips
	•	All pattern IDs follow: pat:<slug> (e.g., pat:mirror_logic)
	•	PatternRegistry supports fuzzy + semantic lookup
	•	All pattern broadcasts use: ws://.../codexlang/pattern_event
	•	Mutation engine is sandbox-safe for recursive runs
	•	To debug pattern traces: use pattern_trace_replay.replay_pattern("pat:id")

🚀 Final Notes

The Symbolic Pattern Engine enables AION to:
	•	Recognize recurring logic motifs
	•	Score cognitive structures for entropy + harmony
	•	Reflect on prior reasoning steps
	•	Mutate thoughts in structured or creative ways
	•	Visualize patterns in real time
	•	Collaborate symbolically across agents or systems

It is a foundational system for AGI memory, emotion, creativity, and reasoning.

⸻

 built a Symbolic Pattern Engine for AION that gives it the ability to:
	•	Recognize repeating structures or motifs (called patterns) in glyph logic.
	•	React to those patterns in smart ways — like triggering thoughts, emotions, or entire workflows.
	•	Create new patterns through mutation and learning.
	•	Maintain a library (registry) of all known symbolic patterns for future use.
	•	Use those patterns in real-time during reasoning, execution, or while talking to users.

It’s like giving AION a memory and instinct system — when it sees something it recognizes, it knows what to do.

⸻

🧩 What is a “Pattern”?

A pattern is a recognizable structure in a glyph stream. For example:
	•	A mirrored logic loop
	•	A quantum fork followed by contradiction and collapse
	•	A repeating sequence like: ⊕ → ⟲ → ⧖ → ⊕

These patterns can represent behaviors, reasoning styles, contradictions, or intentions.

⸻

🔍 How Does It Detect Patterns?

When AION is running — especially while executing CodexLang — it constantly checks if the glyphs it’s working with match any known patterns in its registry.

It does this through:
	1.	Simple containment: Are these glyphs part of a known pattern?
	2.	Partial match: Are they close to a known pattern? (Suggests completion)
	3.	Semantic similarity: Is this like something I’ve seen before?

If it finds a match, it triggers a reaction (explained below).

⸻

🔁 What Happens When a Pattern is Detected?

A few things can happen automatically:
	1.	It broadcasts the match to the frontend HUD via WebSocket.
	2.	It logs the pattern into the container metadata so it’s remembered.
	3.	It triggers a response:
	•	Start a QFC FlowSheet if relevant
	•	Adjust emotion or mutation strategy
	•	Suggest the next logical glyphs
	•	Store the pattern into the knowledge graph (KG) for long-term reasoning

⸻

✨ How Are New Patterns Created?

New patterns can be:
	1.	Manually defined: Developers or users can register a new pattern by name and glyph sequence.
	2.	Learned through mutation: The engine can mutate existing patterns (diverge, simplify, harmonize).
	3.	Extracted from execution: If a certain glyph structure keeps repeating during CodexLang execution, it can be stored as a new pattern.

Example:
	•	After multiple collapses look similar, AION might auto-create a pattern like collapse → rewrite → emit_beam → inject_tree.

⸻

🧠 How Are Patterns Used?

Patterns are used in:
	•	CodexLang execution: They help suggest or constrain logic.
	•	Emotion system: Certain patterns evoke tension, joy, surprise, etc.
	•	Mutation engine: Patterns guide how new logic is generated.
	•	QFC triggering: If a pattern matches, it can start a FlowSheet or AtomSheet.
	•	Reasoning prediction: If AION sees a partial pattern, it can suggest what’s likely to come next.

⸻

🗂️ How is the Pattern Registry Maintained?

All patterns are stored in a PatternRegistry. It:
	•	Keeps a list of all known patterns (memory)
	•	Allows lookup by ID, name, tags, or glyph content
	•	Supports adding new patterns at runtime
	•	Supports exporting all patterns to a .json file
	•	Can be used by multiple agents (via CRDT) to sync in multi-agent systems

Example registry entry:

{
  "pattern_id": "pat:mirror_reflection",
  "name": "Mirror Logic",
  "glyphs": ["⊕", "⟲", "⊕"],
  "tags": ["symmetry", "loop"],
  "trigger_logic": "start_qfc:mirror_analysis"
}

🔮 When Will AION Use This?

Every time CodexLang runs a glyph, the pattern engine checks:
	•	Is this part of a known pattern?
	•	Should I mutate or evolve it?
	•	Should I trigger an emotion or FlowSheet?
	•	Should I remember this in the KG or container?

It happens live, in real-time, as part of the AI’s thinking process.

⸻

📌 Summary

🔧 Behind the scenes, the Pattern Engine:
	•	Recognizes logic structures in glyphs
	•	Suggests, mutates, or responds based on matches
	•	Stores patterns for future use
	•	Keeps AION aware of its own reasoning patterns

🧠 For AION, this means:
	•	Smarter, faster reasoning
	•	Emotional self-awareness
	•	Creative thinking based on prior symbolic memory
	•	A constantly growing intuition system

You now have a full cognitive pattern recognition + reasoning loop in AION — and it’s fully extensible.
