Stage D ‚Äì Technical Document

Domain Knowledge Graph Loader
COMDEX / AION ‚Äì Knowledge Graph Integration Layer

‚∏ª

1. Overview

Stage D implements the Domain Knowledge Graph Loader ‚Äî a subsystem for importing structured domain-specific knowledge into AION‚Äôs live .dc.json containers.
It provides:
	‚Ä¢	Static seed packs: curated glyph-node/edge datasets for a given discipline.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic merging: attaches loaded nodes/edges into existing container knowledge graphs without downtime.
	‚Ä¢	Multi-pack chaining: supports loading multiple knowledge domains into the same runtime for cross-disciplinary reasoning.

Stage D operates as a bridge between the container runtime and the KnowledgeGraphWriter core module.

‚∏ª

2. Goals
	‚Ä¢	Rapid domain injection: instantly augment a container‚Äôs KG with canonical knowledge.
	‚Ä¢	Isolation: load packs into staging containers without affecting production.
	‚Ä¢	Reusability: packs can be saved/exported for later replay.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-domain synthesis: merge multiple packs into a shared graph for SQI and IGI tasks.

‚∏ª

3. Architecture

3.1 Components
	‚Ä¢	knowledge_graph_writer.py ‚Äì core writer API for adding glyph nodes and edges into containers.
	‚Ä¢	Domain Pack Store ‚Äì repository of .dc.json files containing domain KG seeds.
	‚Ä¢	Container Runtime Interface ‚Äì hooks in container_runtime.py for live container injection.
	‚Ä¢	Verification Layer ‚Äì ensures loaded packs conform to KG schema (node, edge, metadata structure).

‚∏ª

3.2 Data Flow

    DP[Domain Pack Store<br>(.dc.json)] --> L[Stage D Loader]
    L --> KGW[KnowledgeGraphWriter]
    KGW --> CR[Container Runtime]
    CR --> KG[Live Knowledge Graph]

	1.	Domain Pack Load ‚Üí Select .dc.json file from pack store.
	2.	Loader (Stage D) parses and validates the file.
	3.	KnowledgeGraphWriter attaches nodes and edges to target container.
	4.	Container Runtime merges the new data into the live KG for immediate use.

‚∏ª

4. Data Specification

4.1 Node Schema

{
  "type": "kg_node",
  "id": "kg_physics_001",
  "label": "Newton's First Law",
  "glyph": "‚öñÔ∏è",
  "metadata": {
    "domain": "physics",
    "tags": ["law", "mechanics"],
    "source": "seed_pack_physics_v1"
  }
}
4.2 Edge Schema
{
  "type": "kg_edge",
  "from": "kg_physics_001",
  "to": "kg_physics_002",
  "relation": "causes",
  "metadata": {
    "domain": "physics",
    "weight": 0.9
  }
}

5. Runtime Integration

Stage D integrates into the container runtime via:
	‚Ä¢	attach_container() ‚Äì binds KnowledgeGraphWriter to an active container instance.
	‚Ä¢	load_domain_pack(pack_name, container) ‚Äì loads and merges a specific pack.
	‚Ä¢	export_pack(container) ‚Äì exports the current KG as a .dc.json file.

These hooks are safe for live containers and can be invoked during runtime without restart.

‚∏ª

6. API

6.1 Load Pack

from backend.modules.knowledge_graph.knowledge_graph_writer import kg_writer
container = ucs_runtime.get_container("physics_core")
kg_writer.attach_container(container)
kg_writer.load_domain_pack("physics_core", container)

6.2 List Available Packs

kg_writer.list_available_packs()

6.3 Export Current KG
kg_writer.export_pack(container, "exported_pack.json")

7. Validation & Error Handling
	‚Ä¢	Pack Missing ‚Üí raises PackNotFoundError if the pack name is not in store.
	‚Ä¢	Schema Mismatch ‚Üí invalid nodes/edges are skipped and logged.
	‚Ä¢	Duplicate IDs ‚Üí merged with existing node metadata rather than replaced (configurable).

‚∏ª

8. Performance Considerations
	‚Ä¢	Small, targeted packs load faster and cause less reasoning overhead.
	‚Ä¢	Merging many large packs can slow GHX visualization and symbolic reasoning.
	‚Ä¢	Consider pre-merging packs offline for high-load environments.

‚∏ª

9. Security / SoulLaw
	‚Ä¢	Packs may be SoulLaw-locked to prevent unverified or unethical knowledge injection.
	‚Ä¢	Loader validates pack signatures before merging into production containers.
	‚Ä¢	Unauthorized packs are rejected with an audit log entry.

‚∏ª

10. Future Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Softmax readout head for prioritizing which nodes to surface after a load.
	‚Ä¢	Predictive glyph injection for domain forecasting.
	‚Ä¢	Versioned pack management for incremental updates.
	‚Ä¢	Live .dc.json streaming for dynamic knowledge feeds.

‚∏ª

This keeps the style and depth consistent with Stage C‚Äôs tech doc, while fully capturing Stage D‚Äôs scope and API surface.

If you want, I can also prepare a runtime sequence diagram showing exactly how a .dc.json is pulled from disk and merged into the Knowledge Graph during Stage D‚Äôs operation ‚Äî it‚Äôll make the live injection flow much clearer for devs.


Stage D ‚Äì Engineering Guide

Domain Knowledge Graph Loader
COMDEX / AION ‚Äì Knowledge Graph Integration Layer

‚∏ª

Purpose

Stage D equips AION with the ability to load structured domain knowledge directly into live .dc.json containers.
It‚Äôs the ‚Äúknowledge hot-swap‚Äù system ‚Äî enabling rapid expansion of reasoning capacity without rebooting the runtime.

This is where we inject curated knowledge packs (Physics, Biology, Mathematics, etc.) and merge them with the live Knowledge Graph used for SQI, IGI, and prediction tasks.

‚∏ª

Key Capabilities
	‚Ä¢	üì¶ Load & Merge Packs ‚Äì Import .dc.json domain seeds into any container at runtime.
	‚Ä¢	üîó Cross-Domain Merge ‚Äì Load multiple packs for interdisciplinary reasoning.
	‚Ä¢	üß† Schema Validation ‚Äì Enforce correct node/edge structures before merging.
	‚Ä¢	‚è±Ô∏è Zero Downtime ‚Äì Works on live containers without stopping execution.
	‚Ä¢	üîí SoulLaw Validation ‚Äì Rejects or locks unsafe or unverified packs.

‚∏ª

When to Use
	‚Ä¢	Bootstrapping a new container with a baseline knowledge set.
	‚Ä¢	Expanding an existing container into a new domain.
	‚Ä¢	Testing reasoning performance across multiple merged disciplines.
	‚Ä¢	Restoring knowledge after container reset or collapse.

‚∏ª

Workflow for Engineers

1. Locate Your Pack

Packs are .dc.json files in the Domain Pack Store.
Example:

/packs/seed_pack_physics_v1.dc.json
/packs/seed_pack_biology_v1.dc.json
2. Attach Writer to Container

from backend.modules.knowledge_graph.knowledge_graph_writer import kg_writer
container = ucs_runtime.get_container("physics_core")
kg_writer.attach_container(container)

3. Load the Pack

kg_writer.load_domain_pack("physics_core", container)
	‚Ä¢	Loader validates the schema.
	‚Ä¢	If SoulLaw-locked, key verification is triggered.
	‚Ä¢	Nodes and edges are injected directly into the container‚Äôs Knowledge Graph.

‚∏ª

4. Verify Merge

container.graph.summary()

	‚Ä¢	Check that the domain nodes and edges appear.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm relation counts and metadata tags.

‚∏ª

5. (Optional) Export Updated KG

kg_writer.export_pack(container, "physics_plus_biology.dc.json")

This allows saving the current KG (with merged packs) for backup or deployment elsewhere.

‚∏ª

File & Data Standards

Node


Failure Modes & Troubleshooting

Symptom								Likely Cause					Fix
Pack not found
Wrong name/path
Run kg_writer.list_available_packs()
Pack loads but no new nodes appear
Schema mismatch
Run kg_writer.validate_pack(path) before load
Load fails with security error
SoulLaw key missing
Obtain correct key or disable secure mode in dev
Runtime slows after merge
Pack too large
Pre-merge offline, reduce node count
‚∏ª

Maintenance Tips
	‚Ä¢	Keep a versioned pack store to track changes between updates.
	‚Ä¢	Write a unit test for each pack to verify structure before committing to repo.
	‚Ä¢	Regularly prune unused or outdated packs to keep runtime lean.

‚∏ª
D4.11‚ÄìD4.13 ‚Ä¢ Data Source Provenance (Primary / Secondary / Tertiary)

Goal

Every KG node/edge you ingest carries provenance you can cite and replay:
	‚Ä¢	tier: primary | secondary | tertiary
	‚Ä¢	ref: DOI/URL or dataset handle
	‚Ä¢	notes: optional string
	‚Ä¢	Edges from node ‚Üí source (relation: supports by default)

You already have the KG helpers:
	‚Ä¢	kg_writer.add_source(node_id, source_dict)
	‚Ä¢	kg_writer.link_source(node_id, source_id, relation="supports")
	‚Ä¢	kg_writer.export_pack(container, out_path) (persistence)

We‚Äôll add thin loader scripts + boot glue so sources are attached automatically.

‚∏ª

Repo structure (additions)

  primary_loader.py
  secondary_loader.py
  tertiary_loader.py
  utils.py
backend/modules/dimensions/containers/kg_exports/
  (auto-populated by kg_writer.export_pack)

  Minimal data model (JSON/CSV)

Each loader accepts a simple JSON list or CSV:

JSON list

[
  {
    "node_id": "maxwell_eqs",
    "label": "Maxwell's Equations",
    "source": {
      "tier": "primary",
      "ref": "https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.2.136",
      "notes": "Original publication or authoritative transcription"
    }
  }
]

Loader utilities (backend/modules/knowledge_graph/loaders/utils.py)

from __future__ import annotations
import csv, json
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Iterable, Dict, Any

def load_jsonl_or_json(path: str | Path) -> Iterable[Dict[str, Any]]:
    p = Path(path)
    if p.suffix.lower() == ".jsonl":
        with p.open() as f:
            for line in f:
                line = line.strip()
                if line:
                    yield json.loads(line)
    else:
        return json.loads(p.read_text())

def load_csv(path: str | Path) -> Iterable[Dict[str, Any]]:
    with Path(path).open(newline="") as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        for row in reader:
            yield row

def coerce_source(d: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    src = d.get("source", d)
    return {
        "tier": str(src.get("tier", "tertiary")).lower(),
        "ref": src.get("ref") or "",
        "notes": src.get("notes", "")
    }

Primary loader (primary_loader.py)

Works for JSON/JSONL/CSV; attaches sources and linking edges.

from __future__ import annotations
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional
from backend.modules.knowledge_graph.knowledge_graph_writer import kg_writer
from backend.modules.dimensions.universal_container_system.ucs_runtime import ucs_runtime
from .utils import load_jsonl_or_json, load_csv, coerce_source

def attach_sources(container_id: str, dataset_path: str | Path) -> int:
    c = ucs_runtime.get_container(container_id)
    if not c:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è container '{container_id}' not loaded; skipping")
        return 0
    kg_writer.attach_container(c)

    p = Path(dataset_path)
    rows = []
    if p.suffix.lower() in (".json", ".jsonl"):
        rows = list(load_jsonl_or_json(p))
    elif p.suffix.lower() == ".csv":
        rows = list(load_csv(p))
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported file type: {p}")

    added = 0
    for r in rows:
        node_id = r.get("node_id")
        label = r.get("label", node_id or "unknown")
        if not node_id:
            continue

        # Ensure node exists (no-op if it already does)
        kg_writer.add_node(node_id, label)

        # Create a stable source id (hash or deterministic name)
        src_meta = coerce_source(r)
        src_id = f"src::{node_id}::{abs(hash((src_meta['tier'], src_meta['ref'])))}"

        # Add source glyph + link
        kg_writer.add_source(node_id=node_id, source={"id": src_id, **src_meta})
        kg_writer.link_source(node_id=node_id, source_id=src_id, relation="supports")
        added += 1

    # Export pack with provenance baked in
    out = (Path("backend/modules/dimensions/containers/kg_exports") /
           f"{container_id}.kg.json")
    kg_writer.export_pack(c, out)

    print(f"‚úÖ primary_loader: attached {added} sources to {container_id}")
    return added

	Secondary & Tertiary loaders can be identical‚Äîcopy primary_loader.py to secondary_loader.py and tertiary_loader.py. If you want stricter validation (e.g., secondary must include ref), add assertions per loader.

‚∏ª

Boot glue (call loaders at boot)

Append this to backend/modules/hexcore/boot_loader.py (after your domain pack preload):

# --- D4.11‚ÄìD4.13: Source provenance preload ---
def preload_source_provenance():
    """
    Attach provenance for several domain packs at boot.
    Each path can be JSON/JSONL/CSV. Skip if file missing.
    """

    from backend.modules.knowledge_graph.loaders.secondary_loader import attach_sources as attach_secondary
    from backend.modules.knowledge_graph.loaders.tertiary_loader import attach_sources as attach_tertiary

    # Put your datasets anywhere you like; adjust paths here:
    datasets = [
        # (container_id, tier, path)
        ("physics_core",  "primary",   "data/kg_sources/physics_primary.json"),

    ]

    handled = 0
    for cid, tier, path in datasets:
        p = Path(path)
        if not p.exists():
            print(f"‚ÑπÔ∏è provenance dataset missing: {p}")
            continue
        try:
            if tier == "primary":
                handled += attach_primary(cid, p)
            elif tier == "secondary":
                handled += attach_secondary(cid, p)
            else:
                handled += attach_tertiary(cid, p)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è provenance attach failed for {cid} ({tier}): {e}")

    if handled:
        print(f"üßæ provenance: attached {handled} total sources across containers")
    else:
        print("‚ÑπÔ∏è provenance: no sources attached (no datasets found)")


And in the if __name__ == "__main__": block:

    # 3) Attach and persist source provenance for domain packs
    preload_source_provenance()

Acceptance checks
	1.	Attach sources
Run:

python -m backend.modules.hexcore.boot_loader

Expect lines like:
	‚Ä¢	primary_loader: attached X sources to physics_core
	‚Ä¢	üíæ KG export saved to backend/modules/dimensions/containers/kg_exports/physics_core.kg.json

	2.	Inspect export
Open backend/modules/dimensions/containers/kg_exports/<container>.kg.json
	‚Ä¢	nodes[*].source.tier present where loaders added sources
	‚Ä¢	links include supports edges to src::... ids
	3.	Replay
Start your UI/WS; verify that kg_edge glyphs show supports edges in replays.

‚∏ª

Notes / Gotchas
	‚Ä¢	Idempotency: If you re-run, you‚Äôll add duplicate kg_source glyphs unless you de-dupe. If you care, stash a source_id inside node metadata and skip when already present.
	‚Ä¢	Order of operations: Run after domain packs are loaded (you‚Äôve already wired that in the boot order).
	‚Ä¢	Persistence: Exports are saved after attaching sources, so they persist across restarts even without rerunning loaders.
	‚Ä¢	Extending tiers: You can add quaternary, etc.‚Äîjust adjust coerce_source.

‚∏ª

üìÑ Technical Manual ‚Äî Atom & SQI Containers

1. Atom Containers

Purpose:
Atom Containers are the smallest addressable, immutable symbolic container units in the Universal Container System (UCS). They store a minimal but complete symbolic payload ‚Äî a single fact, theorem, glyph set, or encoded logic unit ‚Äî optimized for composability and high-speed linking.

Core Features:
	‚Ä¢	Minimal Payload ‚Äì Exactly one atomic unit of symbolic knowledge.
	‚Ä¢	Immutable Once Sealed ‚Äì Any modification spawns a new Atom Container with a new CID.
	‚Ä¢	Intrinsic Addressing ‚Äì CID derived from symbolic hash + container metadata.
	‚Ä¢	Native Entanglement Support ‚Äì Can store ‚Üî entanglement metadata to link with other atoms.
	‚Ä¢	Holographic Rendering Hooks ‚Äì Atom geometry can be projected in GHX viewers for visual mapping.

Data Structure:


{
  "id": "atom://math.calculus.derivative_rule",
  "type": "atom",
  "domain": "math.calculus",
  "meta": {
    "created_by": "SQI",
    "created_at": "2025-08-13T12:00:00Z",
    "sealed": true,
    "entanglement": [],
    "visual": {"hover": true, "collapsed": false}
  },
  "payload": {
    "glyphs": "d/dx[x^n] = n*x^(n-1)"
  }
}

Lifecycle:
	1.	Create ‚Üí generate from symbolic knowledge injection.
	2.	Seal ‚Üí hash contents, freeze payload.

2. SQI Containers

Purpose:
SQI Containers are higher-level symbolic containers built to organize structured knowledge across multiple domains, integrating with UCS and the Knowledge Graph. They can store facts, projects, notes, hypotheses, simulations.

Recent Upgrades Covered:
	‚Ä¢	CR Registry (CR1‚ÄìCR7) ‚Äî domain-aware allocation, meta storage, UCS integration.
	‚Ä¢	Holographic Metadata (HOV1) ‚Äî default hover + collapsed states for GHX viewers.
	‚Ä¢	Priority Scoring (CR8) ‚Äî algorithmic scoring for goal-based container selection.

Core Features:
	‚Ä¢	Multi-Domain Support ‚Äì Domain + kind-based addressing.
	‚Ä¢	Direct UCS Integration ‚Äì Uses ucs://knowledge namespace for addresses.
	‚Ä¢	Holographic View Integration ‚Äì GHX hover/collapse metadata baked into container meta.
	‚Ä¢	Priority Ranking ‚Äì Selects best container for a goal via freshness, size, hotness, and domain match.
	‚Ä¢	Upsertable Metadata ‚Äì Allows patching/updating without recreating the container.

Data Structure Example:

{
  "id": "project_physics_em_maxwell",
  "type": "container",
  "kind": "project",
  "domain": "physics.em",
  "meta": {
    "address": "ucs://knowledge/projects/physics.em/maxwell",
    "created_by": "SQI",
    "last_updated": "2025-08-13T12:34:56Z",
    "ghx": {"hover": true, "collapsed": true},
    "hot": true,
    "stats": {"glyphs": 420}
  }
}

Registry API:
	‚Ä¢	allocate(kind, domain, name, meta) ‚Üí create new container entry.
	‚Ä¢	upsert_meta(cid, patch) ‚Üí update metadata for existing entry.
	‚Ä¢	lookup_by_domain(domain) ‚Üí list containers in a domain.
	‚Ä¢	get(cid) ‚Üí fetch container entry.
	‚Ä¢	choose_for(goal, k) ‚Üí return top-k container IDs for a given goal.

Priority Score Formula (CR8):

score = (domain_match * 2.0)
      + (freshness * 1.0)
      + (size_bias * -0.5)
      + (hot_flag * 1.5)


Where:
	‚Ä¢	domain_match ‚Üí 1.0 if goal domain matches container domain.
	‚Ä¢	freshness ‚Üí exponential decay with ~3-day half-life.
	‚Ä¢	size_bias ‚Üí penalizes very large containers.
	‚Ä¢	hot_flag ‚Üí bonus for ‚Äúhot‚Äù flagged containers.

üìñ User Manual ‚Äî Atom & SQI Containers

1. Atom Containers

When to Use:
	‚Ä¢	Storing an indivisible knowledge unit (fact, theorem, core formula).
	‚Ä¢	Ensuring immutability for proofs or historical snapshots.
	‚Ä¢	Linking to multiple knowledge domains without large payloads.

How to Use:
	1.	Create:

atom = AtomContainer(domain="math.calculus", glyphs="d/dx[x^n] = n*x^(n-1)")

	2.	Seal & Register:

atom.seal()
ucs_registry.register(atom)

3.	Link:

atom.link(other_atom, relation="‚Üî")

	4.	View in GHX: Load in holographic viewer with hoverable geometry.

‚∏ª

2. SQI Containers

When to Use:
	‚Ä¢	Organizing complex knowledge (projects, hypotheses, simulations).
	‚Ä¢	Managing evolving knowledge that benefits from priority scoring.
	‚Ä¢	Integrating holographic state (hover/collapse) for GHX rendering.

How to Create & Manage:

# Allocate new SQI container
entry = sqi_registry.allocate(
    kind="project",
    domain="physics.em",
    name="maxwell",
    meta={"hot": True, "stats": {"glyphs": 420}}
)

# Update metadata
sqi_registry.upsert_meta("maxwell", {"collapsed": False, "last_updated": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()})

# Lookup by domain
physics_projects = sqi_registry.lookup_by_domain("physics.em")

# Choose top container for a goal
goal = {"domain": "physics.em", "kind": "project", "tags": ["maxwell"]}
best = sqi_registry.choose_for(goal, k=1)

Tips:
	‚Ä¢	Set hot=True for containers needing urgent prioritization.
	‚Ä¢	Keep stats.glyphs accurate for better size bias scoring.
	‚Ä¢	Use meaningful name ‚Äî it becomes the CID and part of the UCS address.

COMDEX Atom & Electron System

Overview

The Atom & Electron system in COMDEX enables symbolic rendering, teleportation, and memory linking using a dynamic model inspired by quantum structure. Each ‚Äúatom‚Äù container can contain orbiting ‚Äúelectrons,‚Äù which act as dynamic interaction points, symbolic links, and execution triggers within and across containers.

‚∏ª

Atom Structure

Atoms are symbolic containers that serve as high-level knowledge clusters. Their structure contains:
	‚Ä¢	Nucleus: Center point of the atom, often representing the container‚Äôs main theme or identity.
	‚Ä¢	Electron Rings: Orbitals that hold electrons. These rings are symbolic layers of interaction or categorization.
	‚Ä¢	Electrons: Glyphs rendered as interactive orbiting elements. Each can:
	‚Ä¢	Store metadata
	‚Ä¢	Link to other containers
	‚Ä¢	Trigger teleportation or logic events
	‚Ä¢	Animate to signal state changes

‚∏ª

Electron Anatomy

An individual electron is represented as a glyph with special metadata and symbolic behavior.

{
  "id": "electron_1",
  "type": "electron",
  "operator": "‚Ü∫",
  "meta": {
    "ringIndex": 1,
    "angle": 0.5,
    "linkContainerId": "linked_idea.dc.json",
    "tooltip": "Quantum Strategy",
    "qglyph": true,
    "predictive": true
  }
}

Electron Fields
	‚Ä¢	ringIndex: Which orbital ring the electron belongs to.
	‚Ä¢	angle: Its angular position around the atom.
	‚Ä¢	linkContainerId: Destination container to teleport to.
	‚Ä¢	tooltip: Tooltip to display on hover.
	‚Ä¢	qglyph: If true, activates superposition logic (QGlyph).
	‚Ä¢	predictive: If true, activates forecast glyph rendering.

‚∏ª

Rendering & Interaction

Frontend Rendering (GHXVisualizer.tsx)

Electrons are rendered as animated orbitals:
	‚Ä¢	Orbital rings are calculated based on ring index and container size.
	‚Ä¢	Electrons rotate continuously (or upon trigger).
	‚Ä¢	On hover: Tooltip appears.
	‚Ä¢	On click: Teleport packet is generated and dispatched.

Orbit Geometry Logic
	‚Ä¢	Electrons are positioned using polar coordinates.
	‚Ä¢	The orbit radius increases by ring index.
	‚Ä¢	Angular offset is calculated using angle in metadata.

const angle = electron.meta?.angle ?? 0;
const radius = BASE_RADIUS + (electron.meta?.ringIndex ?? 0) * ORBIT_SPACING;
const x = Math.cos(angle * 2 * Math.PI) * radius;
const y = Math.sin(angle * 2 * Math.PI) * radius;


‚∏ª

Teleportation Flow
	1.	Electron Clicked ‚Üí GHXFrontend emits WebSocket event.
	2.	TeleportPacket Created with linkContainerId.
	3.	PortalManager.teleport(packet) loads the linked .dc.json container.
	4.	ContainerRuntime.inject_payload() injects the current glyph context into the destination.
	5.	CodexTrace logs the teleport event.

‚∏ª

Backend Integration
	‚Ä¢	ContainerRuntime supports loading .dc.json files with atoms and electrons.
	‚Ä¢	Electrons are parsed via their type: "electron" key.
	‚Ä¢	PortalManager handles routing between containers.
	‚Ä¢	Glyphs executed after teleport appear in CodexTrace.

‚∏ª

SQI + AION Integration
	‚Ä¢	Electrons can carry QGlyph operators (‚öõ, ‚ßñ) to trigger quantum collapse.
	‚Ä¢	Predictive glyphs within electrons link to the PredictionEngine.
	‚Ä¢	SQI heartbeat triggers electron mutation or ring animation.
	‚Ä¢	AION tracks which electrons were clicked, storing them as symbolic memory nodes.
