# Separation of Symatics vs Boolean Logic

Status: Draft
Author: Tessaris
Date: 2025-09-25

---

## 1. Motivation
To establish Symatics as a distinct algebra, we must show it cannot be reduced to Boolean logic (`âˆ§, âˆ¨, Â¬`) except in trivial cases.

---

## 2. Boundary Cases
- `(A â‹ˆ[0] B)` behaves like `A âŠ• B` (similar to `âˆ¨`).
- `(A â‹ˆ[Ï€] A)` annihilates to âŠ¥ (similar to contradiction).

Thus, **Boolean behavior appears only at Ï† = 0 or Ï€.**

---

## 3. Non-reducibility
For Ï† â‰  {0, Ï€}, no Boolean connective captures interference:

- Example: `(A â‹ˆ[Ï†] B)` produces phase-sensitive outcomes.
- Boolean connectives are **phase-insensitive**.

Therefore, there is no homomorphism `h : Symatics â†’ Boolean` preserving â‹ˆ semantics.

---

## 4. Theorem Sketch
**Theorem:** âˆ„ Boolean connective `âŠ—` s.t.  
`âˆ€ A,B,Ï†. (A â‹ˆ[Ï†] B) â‰¡ (A âŠ— B)`  
except at Ï† = 0, Ï€.

*Proof outline:* Suppose such `âŠ—` exists. Then for Ï† â‰  0,Ï€, truth-value of `A â‹ˆ[Ï†] B` must vary with Ï†. But all Boolean connectives are invariant under phase. Contradiction.

---

## 5. Consequence
- Symatics strictly extends Boolean logic.
- Lean injection + rewriter confirm this via test `no_distrib` and phase laws.
- This separation justifies publishing Symatics as a novel algebra, not a variant of propositional logic.

# Symatics Separation Note  
*(Irreducibility of â‹ˆ vs Boolean Connectives)*

---

## Context

Classical Boolean logic is governed by universal algebraic laws:  
- Commutativity, associativity, idempotence, distributivity.  
- Every connective (âˆ§, âˆ¨) can be expressed in terms of others.  

The Symatics interference connective `â‹ˆ[Ï†]`, parameterized by a phase Ï†, was introduced to model *interference-style composition* of propositions.  
Axioms (A1â€“A8) capture its expected algebraic behavior (identity, annihilation, phase inversion, cancellation).

---

## Theorem T7 â€” Irreducibility

**Statement:**  
For Ï† âˆ‰ {0, Ï€},  

((A â‹ˆ[Ï†] B) âˆ§ C) â‰  ((A âˆ§ C) â‹ˆ[Ï†] (B âˆ§ C))

**Interpretation:**  
Distributivity fails for interference. Unlike Boolean logic, `â‹ˆ` does **not** distribute over conjunction.  
This irreducibility theorem proves that `â‹ˆ` cannot be defined in terms of âˆ§/âˆ¨ alone.

---

## Significance

- **Beyond-Boolean separation:**  
  Theorem T7 shows that Symatics logic diverges fundamentally from Boolean algebra.  
  Boolean logic enforces distributivity globally; Symatics only preserves it in trivial phase cases (Ï† = 0, Ï€).

- **Expressive novelty:**  
  `â‹ˆ` introduces algebraic behavior unavailable to âˆ§/âˆ¨.  
  This opens the door to modeling phase-sensitive interactions (constructive vs destructive interference).

- **First separation theorem:**  
  T7 is the first rigorously tested theorem that places Symatics logic *outside* the Boolean clone of connectives.  
  In algebraic logic terms, `â‹ˆ` belongs to a strictly larger operator class.

---

## Research Outlook

- **Formal algebraic semantics:**  
  Build a phase-semantic model to characterize the truth conditions of `â‹ˆ` beyond Boolean valuations.  

- **Computational implications:**  
  Benchmark results suggest normalization shrinks complex â‹ˆ-chains, unlike Boolean normal forms.  
  This could offer practical advantages in symbolic reasoning.

- **Future theorems:**  
  T7 is a first step; the next stage is to explore distributive-like patterns for constrained Ï† values (e.g. rational multiples of Ï€) and their relationship to quantum logics.

---

ðŸ“Œ **Summary:**  
Theorem T7 establishes *irreducibility*: the Symatics interference connective `â‹ˆ[Ï†]` cannot be reduced to classical âˆ§/âˆ¨.  
This separation is the cornerstone of Symaticsâ€™ claim to novelty as a logical system.
