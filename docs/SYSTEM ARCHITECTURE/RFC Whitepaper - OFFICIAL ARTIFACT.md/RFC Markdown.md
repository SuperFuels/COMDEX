# 📜 Symatics Algebra RFC v0.1  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** [Your Name / Team]

## 1. Introduction  

Symatics Algebra defines a new formal framework where the **primitive units of mathematics are physical waves and photons** rather than abstract numbers.  

Whereas classical arithmetic is built on invented units (`0,1,2,3…`) and symbolic operators (`+,−,×,÷`), Symatics is grounded in **observable signatures**: frequency, phase, amplitude, polarization.  

This RFC specifies:  
- **Primitives** (🌊 Wave, 💡 Photon)  
- **Axioms** (existence, superposition, entanglement, resonance, collapse, identity, conservation)  
- **Operators** (⊕ superposition, ↔ entanglement, ⟲ resonance, ∇ collapse, ⇒ trigger)  
- **Laws** governing their algebraic behavior  
- **Mechanized Proof Integration** (Lean → container pipeline, validation, regression tests)  

The goal is to establish a reproducible, testable, and publishable foundation for Symatics as a mathematical discipline.

## 2. Terminology & Primitives  

- **🌊 Wave** → base measurable unit, tuple over {frequency, phase, amplitude, polarization}.  
- **💡 Photon** → indivisible carrier of a wave-glyph.  
- **⊕ Superposition** → combine waves into interference patterns.  
- **↔ Entanglement** → bind waves into non-separable states.  
- **⟲ Resonance** → cyclic reinforcement/decay of a wave.  
- **∇ Collapse** → measurement → discrete symbolic signature.  
- **⇒ Trigger** → execution operator, bridging symbolic → runtime (CodexCore, Qwave).  

---

## 3. Axioms  

1. **Existence**: ∃🌊 at least one wave.  
2. **Superposition**: ∀a,b ∈ Waves → a ⊕ b exists.  
3. **Entanglement**: ∀a≠b ∈ Waves → a ↔ b forms bound state.  
4. **Resonance**: ⟲(a) amplifies/damps wave depending on frequency match.  
5. **Collapse**: ∇(a) → discrete signature σ.  
6. **Identity**: a ⊕ ∅ = a.  
7. **Conservation**: ⊕, ↔, ∇ preserve total information.

## 4. Operators & Laws  

### ⊕ Superposition  
- Type: W × W → W  
- Associative: (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c).  
- Phase-conditional commutativity: a ⊕ b = b ⊕ a iff Δφ = 2πk.  
- Identity: a ⊕ ∅ = a.  

### ↔ Entanglement  
- Type: W × W → BoundState  
- Non-commutative: a ↔ b ≠ b ↔ a.  
- Collapse of one defines the other.  

### ⟲ Resonance  
- Type: W → W  
- Amplify if f≈f₀ (natural frequency).  
- Dampen if f≠f₀.  

### ∇ Collapse  
- Type: S → 𝒟[Σ] (distribution over signatures).  
- Non-deterministic but reproducible.  
- Normalization: ∑Σ 𝒟[Σ] = 1.  

### ⇒ Trigger  
- Type: (Σ→α) × S → S′.  
- Only operator permitted external side-effects.

## 5. Rulebook Examples  

**Example 1 — Symatics “1+1=2”**  
- Classical: 1 + 1 = 2  
- Symatics: 🌊 ⊕ 🌊 → ∇ {“2a” signature}  

**Example 2 — Gravity Relation**  

GRAV ⊕ MASS{m₁,m₂} ↔ COORD{r} ⇒ 🌍

**Example 3 — Quantum Gate**  

⊕ ↔ ∇ → Hadamard-like collapse

## 6. Mechanized Proof Integration (Lean Pipeline)  

Symatics axioms and laws are **injectable into Lean** via the container pipeline:  

- ✅ Lean → container JSON  
- ✅ Validation + audit trail persisted in container  
- ✅ Roundtrip regression tests for ⊕, ↑, and ⋈[φ] axioms  
- ✅ Standalone mode (Symatics-only parsing/validation)  
- ✅ Integrated mode (with Codex normalization, SQI scoring, mutation hooks)  
- ✅ Diagrams: Mermaid proof trees, DOT graphs, PNG exports  

**Example injected axiom (Lean → container):**  

```lean
axiom self_zero_id : (A ⋈[0] A) ↔ A

Results in container JSON with exact roundtrip on logic, logic_raw, symbolicProof.

7. Validation & Reporting
	•	All containers persist validation_errors with versioning.
	•	Audit logs (lean_audit.jsonl) track injection events.
	•	Reports exportable as Markdown, JSON, or HTML.
	•	Previews (Mermaid/PNG) stored in container.

⸻

8. Extensions & Future Work
	•	Symatics Calculus: Δ, ∫ analogs defined in operator space.
	•	New Theorems: prove results irreducible to Boolean logic.
	•	SQI Integration: emotion-weighted scoring, mutation overlays.
	•	QFC Projection: project collapse events into quantum frequency cones.
	•	Whitepaper v0.2: publish external-facing version with worked case studies.
