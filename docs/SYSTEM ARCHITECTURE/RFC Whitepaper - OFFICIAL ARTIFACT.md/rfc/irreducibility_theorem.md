Symatics Algebra: First Beyond-Boolean Theorem

What we achieved
	•	We encoded the interference operator ⋈[φ] with axioms A1–A8.
	•	We formally proved Theorem 7 (Irreducibility):

For all φ ≠ {0, π}, distributivity fails:
(A ⋈[φ] B) ∧ C \;\neq\; (A ∧ C) ⋈[φ] (B ∧ C)

Why it matters
	•	In Boolean algebra, distributivity is always valid.
	•	In Symatics algebra, distributivity fails generically, except trivial φ.
	•	This proves Symatics is not reducible to Boolean logic.

Significance
	•	T1–T6 show phase-specific algebraic laws (identity, annihilation, cancellation, etc.).
	•	T7 is the first irreducibility theorem: a structural property distinguishing Symatics from classical logic.
	•	This marks the first separation result between Symatics algebra and Boolean algebra.

Implications
	•	Symatics cannot be simulated as a conservative extension of Boolean logic.
	•	It opens the door to new computational primitives beyond standard digital logic (e.g. phase-sensitive computation).
