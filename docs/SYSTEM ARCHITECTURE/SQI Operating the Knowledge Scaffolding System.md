üìÑ 1. User Manual ‚Äî ‚ÄúOperating the Knowledge Scaffolding System‚Äù

What This Is

These .dc.json scaffolds are knowledge blueprints ‚Äî structured symbolic graphs that AION/SQI can use to store, organize, and link real domain knowledge.
Right now, a scaffold without real data is like an empty building frame: it has rooms, labels, and pathways, but no furniture.
When we fill them with data, they become living knowledge containers that SQI can simulate, cross-link, and learn from.

Core Concept
	‚Ä¢	Scaffolding = semantic structure: nodes (concepts) + links (relations) + metadata (context).
	‚Ä¢	Filling = attaching real knowledge: datasets, proofs, equations, curated literature, models, simulations.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-linking = connecting concepts across scaffolds so the AI can reason across disciplines.

Workflow to Specialize the System
	1.	Choose the domain or problem
Example:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúSolve advanced physics control problems‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúProve unsolved mathematics theorems‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOptimize fusion reactor control loops‚Äù
	2.	Locate the relevant .dc.json scaffolds
These live in:


backend/modules/knowledge_graph/indexes/
or /containers/seeds/

e.g. physics_core.dc.json, data_secondary.dc.json, math_proofs.dc.json

	3.	Acquire the real domain knowledge
	‚Ä¢	Mathematics ‚Üí Lean mathlib, Coq libraries, arXiv proofs
	‚Ä¢	Physics ‚Üí experimental datasets, simulations, canonical textbooks, NIST tables
	‚Ä¢	Biology ‚Üí genomics datasets, curated pathway databases
	‚Ä¢	Economics ‚Üí time series, IMF/WB datasets, macro/micro studies
	4.	Convert it into container-ready format
	‚Ä¢	Use lean_to_glyph.py for proofs
	‚Ä¢	Use data_ingest.py for structured datasets
	‚Ä¢	Store in /containers/fill/ as .dc.json or .dc
	‚Ä¢	Ensure node IDs match the scaffold node IDs
	5.	Load the filled container into SQI
	‚Ä¢	Drop into /containers/live/ or /containers/runtime/
	‚Ä¢	Boot via boot_loader.py (auto-applies cross_links.dc.json)
	‚Ä¢	System will auto-index & cross-reference with other loaded scaffolds
	6.	Run specialization cycles
	‚Ä¢	Start simulations (sqi_simulator.py)
	‚Ä¢	Monitor reasoning path in CodexHUD or Entanglement Graph
	‚Ä¢	Measure improvement in problem-solving speed/accuracy

‚∏ª

When the System Becomes ‚ÄúExponential‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Each filled container links into others via symbolic relations (feeds, registered_in, promoted_to, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Once you fill dozens or hundreds of scaffolds, the network acts like a massively entangled neural-symbolic web ‚Äî it can:
	‚Ä¢	Recombine knowledge from distant fields
	‚Ä¢	Build entirely new reasoning chains
	‚Ä¢	Predict solutions across domains

Architecture Overview
	‚Ä¢	Containers: .dc.json or .dc files = domain-specific symbolic graphs
	‚Ä¢	Scaffold: nodes + links + metadata, no payload
	‚Ä¢	Filled Container: same scaffold, but each node contains knowledge payload
	‚Ä¢	Cross-linker: cross_links.dc.json ensures different domain containers reference each other

Container File Anatomy

{
  "id": "data_secondary",       // container unique ID
  "name": "Secondary Data...",  // human-readable name
  "symbol": "üìñ",                // glyph emoji for CodexHUD
  "metadata": {
    "domain": "Data",
    "tier": "secondary",
    "linked_domains": [...]
  },
  "glyph_categories": [...],    // semantic groupings
  "nodes": [...],                // conceptual entities
  "links": [...]                 // relationships
}

How Knowledge Gets Into the System
	1.	Scaffold Creation ‚Äî define structure, categories, node IDs, and relations.
	2.	Knowledge Mapping ‚Äî map real-world sources to scaffold node IDs.
	3.	Conversion & Normalization ‚Äî all inputs become .dc.json objects with:
	‚Ä¢	node.knowledge: inline or reference to file/URL
	‚Ä¢	node.proofs: Lean/Codex glyph versions
	‚Ä¢	node.data_hash: checksum for verification
	4.	Container Injection ‚Äî place filled containers into /runtime folder.
	5.	Cross-link Resolution ‚Äî boot loader merges scaffolds & cross-links.
	6.	SQI Simulation ‚Äî runtime executes reasoning over graph:
	‚Ä¢	Traverses relations
	‚Ä¢	Loads payloads into symbolic memory
	‚Ä¢	Runs Codex/Tessaris planning on them
