⚙️ Execution Order — Tessaris Quantum-Holographic Stack

Phase                   Subsystem                       What It Does                            Dependency Notes
1
🧩 Photon / QWave Core (Photonic Computation)
Builds the physical or virtual substrate that emits, routes, and collapses quantum–symbolic beams.
Must exist before any holographic projection — the hologram is rendered from beam interference data.
2
🌊 LightWave / Symatics Engine (SLE)
Adds virtual photonic physics — superposition, interference, decoherence, and beam algebra (⊕, ∇, ↔, etc.).
Depends on QWave + Photon simulation — it’s your photonic compute layer.
3
🧠 GlyphNet + GHX System
Encodes holographic glyph logic, GHX packets, replay system, and HUD overlays.
Relies on QWave/SLE to provide beam event data.
4
⚡ Dual CPU Integration (Virtual + QWave CPU)
Allows both symbolic and photonic ops to execute in a coordinated runtime.
Unifies legacy CPU + QWave emitter, enabling hybrid scheduling.
5
🌌 HQCE (H-Series Holographic Quantum Cognition Engine)
Computes ψ–κ–T tensors, semantic gravity, and morphic feedback for self-regulating holographic cognition.
Needs the GHX + QWave systems alive — it reads their beams and renders holograms.
6
🔁 UltraQC Orchestration
Synchronizes Symbolic ↔ Photonic ↔ Holographic loops, rollback, and SQI feedback.
Combines all prior phases; runs in dual-core simulation.
7
📜 Morphic Ledger & Signing
Logs ψκT and SQI over time with GlyphVault signatures.
Final stage — relies on data from HQCE runtime.
8
🧪 E2E Validation & Demos
Run full UltraQC holographic cognition loop with replay, drift tracking, and ledger verification.
Uses the entire stack.
