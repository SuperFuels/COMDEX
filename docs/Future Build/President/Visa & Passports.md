Would you like me to:
	1.	🧾 Draft the Tessaris Entry & Citizenship Charter document
	2.	💻 Build passport_registry.py + visa_verifier.py modules (backend)
	3.	🌐 Design a passport dashboard UI for the frontend
	4.	🔐 Connect access control to container gates, runtime, and teleporters

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I’ll begin implementation or drafting immediately.
