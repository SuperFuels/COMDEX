Task                Layer           Description                     Key Notes
meta_axioms_v02.py
Core Runtime
Encode Geometry → Computation axioms as structured meta-laws
Source of truth for runtime verification
pi_s_closure.py
Validator
Checks πₛ closure numerically (2πₛ n invariants)
Ensures coherence of phase-space resonance
axioms.py
Integration
Merges META_AXIOMS into rulebook
Enables engine-wide visibility
test_meta_axioms_v02.py
Tests
Verifies runtime law compliance
Confirms numeric + symbolic consistency
theorem_ledger/schema.json
Data Layer
Adds fields for domain, validation, timestamps
Supports CodexTrace and analytics


🔧 Workflow Notes
	•	Lean side remains your formal proof layer — the mathematical truth source.
	•	Python side becomes your runtime execution layer — verifies laws during simulation or computation.
	•	CodexGlyph serves as the bridge ensuring both remain synchronized.
	•	After this integration, Symatics becomes “live mathematics” — axioms exist simultaneously as formal theorems and executable runtime constraints.

Would you like me to now generate the Python scaffolding files (meta_axioms_v02.py, pi_s_closure.py, test_meta_axioms_v02.py) directly so you can paste them into /backend/symatics/core/?
That would activate Phase 2 of this roadmap immediately.
