sym_tactics_physics.py ‚Ä¢ test_symatics_physics.py
üß© In progress (we‚Äôll add next)
3. Integration + Documentation Layer
Exposes results to researchers via docs, Jupyter notebooks, GitHub Pages, and the CLI.

üß± 1Ô∏è‚É£ Symbolic Core (You already have this)
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Establish the formal laws of Symatics Algebra (e.g. Collapse‚ÄìResonance Equivalence).
	‚Ä¢	Implements: Lean theorem + Python validator (energy_mass_equivalence).
	‚Ä¢	Output: True/False symbolic invariants, matching mathematical consistency.

‚úÖ Fully functional.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ Applied Physics Layer (New functionality)
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Translate the symbolic laws into real, testable, measurable predictions.
	‚Ä¢	Modules to add:
	‚Ä¢	sym_tactics_physics.py
	‚Ä¢	infer_mass_from_trace()
	‚Ä¢	pair_threshold()
	‚Ä¢	binding_energy_from_trace()
	‚Ä¢	test_symatics_physics.py
‚Äî pytest coverage with synthetic and calibrated cases.
	‚Ä¢	Documentation link: /docs/Symatics_Operator_Mapping.md
‚Äî your ‚ÄúRosetta Stone‚Äù table connecting operators to real instruments.

üß© This is what we‚Äôll build next.

‚∏ª

üß† 3Ô∏è‚É£ Integration & Documentation Layer (Optional but powerful)

This is the ‚Äúdeveloper + scientist‚Äù interface.
Once you add it, others can use Symatics like a scientific toolkit ‚Äî both symbolically and empirically.


Subsystem                       Description                         Example
CLI / REPL interface
Command-line driver for running checks, e.g. symatics verify energy, symatics infer-mass data.csv
/cli/symatics_tool.py
Jupyter Notebook demos
Tutorials combining symbolic + numeric examples
/examples/Symatics_Notebook.ipynb
Docs site (GitHub Pages)
Autogenerated from /docs/*.md for public display
/docs/Symatics_Operator_Mapping.md ‚Üí /docs/index.html
Theorem Index
A catalog of all verified Symatics laws + their Lean signatures
/docs/Symatics_Theorem_Index.md
Data Integration Hooks
Adapters for importing lab traces (CSV, HDF5, etc.)
/backend/dataio/trace_loader.py


This layer isn‚Äôt strictly required for computation, but it‚Äôs essential for adoption ‚Äî it makes Symatics a research-grade SDK.

Symatics Operator Mapping

Version: 2.1
Author: Tessaris AI
Last updated: October 2025

‚∏ª

üß† Purpose

This document maps the symbolic operators of Symatics Algebra to their measurable laboratory and computational equivalents.
It serves as a translation layer between the mathematical formalism and real experimental instruments.

Relation to Symatic Law

E_{\text{meas}} = k_\phi \, \dot{\phi} \, \mu
	‚Ä¢	\dot{\phi}: phase rotation rate (wave persistence)
	‚Ä¢	\mu: collapse (measurement rate)
	‚Ä¢	k_\phi: equivalence constant (‚âà c^2)
	‚Ä¢	E_{\text{meas}}: observed energy flux

‚∏ª

Experimental Pathways
	1.	In-silico simulation ‚Äì numerical validation of bilinear law.
	2.	Photonics interferometry ‚Äì tunable collapse via tap ratio.
	3.	Qubit weak-measurement ‚Äì measurement-dependent energy scaling.

‚∏ª

Cross-Platform Projection

Under metric projection:
k_\phi \, \dot{\phi}/\omega_C \rightarrow c^2
so that the Symatic framework reproduces Einstein‚Äôs E = mc^2 as a limiting case.
