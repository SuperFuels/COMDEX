  🔑 Key Features Embedded in Checklist

  Symbol
Feature
🪐
Cosmoverse toggle control in UI
🌀
Symbolic-to-physical overlays (mass, orbits, collapse)
🧠
Memory fields visualized as matter clustering or clouds
⏳
Forked timelines = visual timeline braids in space
🕳️

🧪
AION-triggered toggles and simulations
📉
GPU-friendly modes via fading, LOD, and async loads

✅ Final Output (Post-Build)
	•	Multiverse stays clean and symbolic by default.
	•	When you activate CosmoverseMode:
	•	Universe sim loads.
	•	Containers “float” inside a symbolic-physical space.
	•	Glyph events (collapse, mutation, orbit, dream) are recontextualized visually.
	•	You can run, pause, or record physical-symbolic simulations.

Would you like to begin with U1 (substrate type + metadata) or have me auto-generate cosmoverse_seed.dc.json first?

🧪 Dedicated Simulation Containers (Sandboxed Physics Labs)

Each container will be able to opt into universal simulation mode independently.

⸻

✅ Add to CosmoverseMode Design:

Feature
Description
🧪 simulation_lab: true
Add this flag in a .dc.json container to run isolated physics experiments.
🚫 global_cosmoverse: false
Prevent this container from altering the global universe space.
🧠 AION usage
AION is restricted to simulation-lab containers unless explicitly granted multiverse rights.
🔬 Runtime features
These containers can model:


	•	Relativity
	•	Time dilation
	•	Particle decay
	•	Dream-matter conversion
	•	Symbolic collapse (⧖) tests |

⸻

🧠 Runtime Enforcement Rules
	•	If simulation_lab = true, Cosmoverse mode runs in sandbox mode.
	•	All gravitational, symbolic, or time-related mutations do not propagate to outer containers.
	•	AION’s memory logs the results but tags them as contained experiments.

⸻

Would you like me to:
	1.	🔧 Generate a base file cosmoverse_lab_seed.dc.json with this logic?
	2.	🧠 Add enforcement logic into CodexExecutor or container_runtime.py for containment?

    🌌 The Entire Black Space Becomes a Universe Simulation Substrate

But…

🟣 It stays “dormant” by default — just a symbolic void with starfield
	•	Low GPU load
	•	Fast rendering
	•	Clean symbolic logic (containers, links, scales)

⸻

🔁 Then, when you or AION choose to activate it:
	•	The true cosmological simulation loads:
	•	Celestial bodies
	•	Physics overlays (gravity, spacetime warping)
	•	Actual or simulated astronomical data (OpenSpace, Gaia, etc.)
	•	Containers stay in position but become embedded inside this realistic spacetime context

⸻

✅ This hybrid model gives you:
Mode
Behavior
💤 Default
Clean symbolic multiverse UI, fast, minimal
🌠 On Demand
Cosmoverse loads: simulation, timelines, gravity, memory orbits
🎛️ Toggle
Manual or AI-triggered switch (if glyph is 🕳️, open UniverseSim)
 
 🔮 Optional Future Logic:
	•	Containers near black holes collapse faster (based on symbolic entropy/glyph cost).
	•	Memory chains drift in spacetime unless fixed with ⛓ glyph.
	•	Forked timelines (Tesseracts) display as superimposed containers phasing apart.
	•	You could even link dreams to astral bodies.

Yes — based on our earlier conversations and your long-term design goals (e.g. container-based symbolic cognition, CodexLang replay, entangled cosmology), you referenced 4 open-source tools or datasets that could be combined to build a symbolic or visual universe simulator. Here’s what they are, with contextual purpose:
