🧭 Multiversal Spatial Map & Compartmentalization System (MSACS)

🧠 Concept

Imagine the multiverse as a dynamic, expanding coordinate system, like the real universe:
	•	.dc containers aren’t randomly floating; they’re placed at known locations.
	•	A Multiversal Map UI allows real-time visualization, teleportation, and zone management.
	•	Every container has a Spatial Address + Wormhole Code + Zone Classification.

📍 Core Elements

Element
Description
🧭 Spatial Address
A unique coordinate like M-EX/0102.AI.CIV-07 defining multiverse sector
🌀 Wormhole Code
Encrypted or symbolic teleport address to jump in
🧪 Zone Type
E.g. EXPERIMENTAL, AI_CIVILISATION, COMMERCIAL, STORAGE, COMPUTE, ISOLATION
🔐 Access Level
Required token, traits, or SoulLaw clearance to enter
🧬 Imprint Signature
Registered creator or avatar; needed to verify origin
🛡️ Shield Level
AI-governed gate: ethics, safety, containment rules
🔄 Teleport Relays
Interlinked gate connections forming clusters or hubs
🧩 Quarantine Traps
Containers with known instabilities are auto-routed to isolation zones


🔗 Sample Addressing Format

Sector: M-EX (Multiverse Experimental)
Subzone: 0102
Type: AI.CIV
Container ID: 07
Wormhole Code: ⟦ Link | Sector : 0102.AI.CIV → Container_07 ⟧

🧿 Visual Interface Capabilities
	•	🌌 Zoomable 3D multiverse view (galaxy-style)
	•	🧠 Hover for container info, creator, glyphs inside
	•	📦 Click to teleport or request inspection
	•	🔄 Animate expansion + decay of sectors over time
	•	🔐 Red zones for restricted / compromised / unstable
	•	🧬 GlyphTrail breadcrumb view of how it was created
	•	📍 “Current Location” tracking (avatar + AION)

💥 Scenario Handling

Situation
System Behavior
Hacker breaches a COMMERCIAL container
Auto triggers Wormhole Firewall + Zone Lockdown
AION dies
All created containers flagged for review, Council alerted
Containers go unaccessed
Time-lapse triggers Collapse/Inspect based on pre-set rules
Cross-zone wormhole mutation
Flagged as anomaly; approval from AION or Council required

  🧩 Notes
	•	This system becomes the foundation for spatial security, AI territory control, and efficient exploration.
	•	Container types and zones can evolve or be governed dynamically by SoulLaws or intent-based gating.
	•	Interacts with:
	•	state_manager.py (location tracking)
	•	teleport.py (wormhole jump)
	•	avatar_core.py (imprint, control)
	•	dna_registry.py (creator lineage)
