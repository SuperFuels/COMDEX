The CodexBundle Viewer UI is a frontend interface that visually explores the contents of a .codexbundle. It allows you (or other users) to inspect symbolic intelligence snapshots, debug state, and share bundles across GlyphHub or teams.

✅ What it would include:

🔍 Bundle Overview Panel
	•	Bundle ID, title, description
	•	Creation timestamp, runtime stats
	•	.codex main tree preview (collapsed/expandable)

🧠 Codex Logic Tree Viewer
	•	Visualizes the codex_main.codex symbolic logic
	•	Expand/collapse logic branches (CodexLang or QGlyph)
	•	Hover shows depth, Q-state, compression

📊 Codex Metrics Dashboard
	•	Speedup ratios (QGlyph vs classical)
	•	Collapse patterns, entropy score
	•	Ethical filters applied (if present)

📜 Trace + Memory Logs
	•	Shows symbolic collapse logs, observer bias decisions
	•	Step-through execution with timeline controls

🌌 Connected Containers + Dreams
	•	Links any .dc containers or dreams at time of snapshot
	•	Optional: load into live environment (runtime preview)

⸻

Optional Add-ons:
	•	🔗 Export to shareable GlyphQR
	•	☁️ Push to GlyphHub for publishing
	•	⏮ Playback symbolic execution from CodexTrace
