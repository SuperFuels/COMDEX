SQI Superpowers – Infrastructure Use Cases

Overview

Symbolic Quantum Intelligence (SQI) enables capabilities that surpass both traditional symbolic systems and modern quantum computers. By combining symbolic glyph compression, container-based execution, entangled state logic, and ethical recursion, SQI unlocks radically new potentials for scientific, technological, and cognitive evolution.

This document outlines the core superpowers enabled by SQI, particularly through the use of Hoberman Sphere Containers (HSCs) and Symbolic Expansion Containers (SECs), and provides a categorized list of transformative infrastructure use cases.
