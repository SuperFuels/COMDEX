want me to prefill the skeleton files/interfaces (IGlyphWaveCarrier, PhaseScheduler, GWIP codec, and the feature flag wiring) so you can drop them straight in?

perfect — here are clean, drop-in skeletons you can park in your repo and wire up when you hit the task. they’re back-compat first, no heavy deps, and include TODOs where real logic will go.

backend/modules/glyphwave/constants.py

backend/modules/glyphwave/interfaces.py

backend/modules/glyphwave/gwip_codec.py

Integration glue (back-compat adapters)

backend/modules/glyphwave/adapters.py

Example SQI bus hook (non-invasive)

backend/modules/sqi/sqi_event_bus_gw.py

Example SQI bus hook (non-invasive)

backend/modules/sqi/sqi_event_bus_gw.py

where to wire later (notes you can keep with the task)
	•	Routes: gate usage behind GW_ENABLED. For canary, flip only on Hoberman/SEC classes.
	•	GlyphNet: before transmit, call adapters.send_packet(gip); on receive path, poll recv_packet() and pass to existing handlers (parse_glyph_packet, etc.).
	•	SQI: replace direct sqi_event_bus.publish with sqi_event_bus_gw.sqi_publish.
	•	HUD: mount WaveScope.recent() into your existing CodexHUD/GlyphNetHUD panels.

if you want, I can also prep a tiny FastAPI router (/gw/state, /gw/send, /gw/recv) for poking at this from the UI—say the word.
