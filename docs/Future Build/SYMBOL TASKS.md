C6. Canonicalizer merge (Symatics + CodexLang) — defer until Phase 2 / Photon
	•	What: Right now we have two canonicalizers:
	•	Symatics (domain-specific resonance/axioms)
	•	CodexLang (AST → registry normalization).
	•	Need to do: Merge them into one canonicalizer so all symbols/operators flow through a single normalization pipeline.
	•	Why: Prevents drift where the same op (⊕ etc.) might be canonicalized differently in Codex vs Symatics. It ensures the AST → runtime path is one consistent language.
	•	When: After Photon Algebra is introduced, since Photon will add new canonicalization rules.

⸻

C10. Entanglement/Quantum ops unified (↔, ⧜, ⧝, ⧠) — full unify post-Photon
	•	What: Quantum/entanglement operators (↔, ⧜, ⧝, ⧠) exist in multiple layers: Codex, Glyph, Symatics.
	•	Need to do: Collapse these into a single set of handlers and representations in registry.
	•	Why: Right now they’re fragmented. Photon Algebra will formalize entanglement/quantum semantics, so we can unify around that spec.
	•	When: After Photon operator set is stable.

⸻

C18. Axioms/laws consistency check — expand only after Photon algebra defined
	•	What: Tooling to check that symbolic axioms (e.g., distributive, resonance symmetries) are not violated by runtime implementations.
	•	Need to do: Write validators that confirm algebraic properties hold across Codex, Symatics, Photon layers.
	•	Why: Ensures mathematical integrity. Without it, we risk “silent contradictions” where runtime ops diverge from formal laws.
	•	When: Post-Photon spec, because Photon introduces new algebraic laws to check.

⸻

🚀 Photon Algebra Readiness

P1. Photon operators exposed (⊙, ≈, wave ops) — stubs only now
	•	What: Define new Photon-level ops (⊙ fusion, ≈ resonance equivalence, wave operators).
	•	Need to do: Stub them in registry as no-op or placeholder functions.
	•	Why: Lets us start wiring tests and documentation early, while semantics get finalized later.

⸻

P2. Photon ↔ Codex bridge wired (registry + dispatcher) — impl after algebra spec
	•	What: Build the bridge so Photon ops in Codex AST are routed to Photon handlers in registry.
	•	Need to do: Extend dispatcher/bridge to recognize photon:* namespace.
	•	Why: This ensures Photon can run side by side with CodexLang and Symatics without hacks.
	•	When: After Photon Algebra operator spec is locked.

⸻

P3. Photon metrics integrated (cycles, resonance, entanglement size) — placeholders only
	•	What: Runtime metrics like cycles taken, resonance stability, entanglement depth.
	•	Need to do: Add lightweight counters in CPU/registry to emit these values, even as placeholders.
	•	Why: Metrics are essential for debugging and tuning — even placeholder numbers give early visibility.

⸻

🧩 Integration & Cleanup

I2. Opcode semantic unification → ⊕, ↔, ⟲, ⧖ consistent everywhere (post-Photon)
	•	What: Some ops still have slightly different semantics in different layers.
	•	Need to do: Normalize across Codex, Symatics, Photon so e.g. ⊕ means exactly the same in all contexts.
	•	Why: Prevents subtle bugs where ops behave differently depending on which dispatcher called them.
	•	When: After Photon extends semantics, so we unify once with full knowledge.

⸻

I4. Schema normalization → AST (CodexLang ↔ Symatics ↔ GlyphOS) match final Photon model
	•	What: Currently AST schemas drift slightly between layers.
	•	Need to do: Lock them to Photon’s schema model.
	•	Why: Once Photon is introduced, schema must be harmonized across languages for interoperability.

⸻

I6. Photon metrics routing → CodexMetrics (cycles, resonance, depth)
	•	What: Route Photon’s metrics into CodexMetrics aggregator.
	•	Need to do: Extend metrics pipeline to collect and export Photon runtime stats.
	•	Why: Keeps all metrics (Codex + Symatics + Photon) in one unified reporting channel.

⸻

I7. Axiom/law contradictions logging → extend after Photon axioms spec
	•	What: Log contradictions (e.g., ⊕ not distributing properly).
	•	Need to do: Write structured logging hooks that trigger when axioms are violated.
	•	Why: Helps debugging and ensures algebraic correctness.
	•	When: After Photon axioms are formally defined.

⸻

I8. Documentation sync → SYMATICS_AXIOMS.md ↔ Codex YAML ↔ instruction_reference.md
	•	What: Sync documentation sources (axioms doc, YAML registry, instruction reference).
	•	Need to do: Add CI step that regenerates docs and fails on drift.
	•	Why: Prevents doc/spec/runtime divergence.

⸻

I10. Context handling → align Codex registers + Photon Algebra state (time dilation, resonance)
	•	What: Photon introduces contextual state (time dilation, resonance levels).
	•	Need to do: Extend CPU/context model to carry this Photon state.
	•	Why: Without it, Photon ops won’t be able to encode their richer semantics.

	🛠 Step 1 — Establish the Base Canonical Symbol Registry
	•	Why first?
Everything else (parser, CPU runtime, Photon Algebra) depends on knowing what ⊗ means where. If we start rewriting code before this, we’ll hit collisions everywhere.
	•	Action
	•	Build a canonical symbol table with:
	•	symbol
	•	domain (logic, physics, quantum, photon, codex)
	•	description
	•	impl/handler (function or registry reference)
	•	Namespace conflicting symbols:
	•	logic:⊗ (negation/XOR)
	•	physics:⊗ (tensor)
	•	symatics:⊗ (fuse)
	•	Enforce lookup always goes through this registry (Codex, GlyphOS, Symatics all pull from it).

⸻

🛠 Step 2 — Decide Immediate Collision Fixes (Critical Path)
	•	Symbols that block integration right now
	•	⊗ (tensor/fuse/negate) → must be namespaced today.
	•	∇ (gradient/compression) → must be tagged (math:∇, compressor:∇).
	•	↔ (entanglement/link/equivalence) → unify into one handler.
	•	⊕ (merge/XOR/superpose) → must be scoped.
	•	⧖ (delay vs quantum collapse) → must be split.
	•	≐ (Schrödinger vs Einstein equation) → must be split.

⸻

🛠 Step 3 — Lock Parser/AST Schema to Registry
	•	Make CodexLang parser + GlyphOS parser resolve symbols by domain via the registry.
	•	Example: ↔ in AST is not just {op:"↔"} but {op:"↔", domain:"quantum"}.
	•	This avoids future drift when Codex adds new ops.

⸻

🛠 Step 4 — CPU Runtime Delegation
	•	Codex CPU runtime (cpu_runtime.py) → stop hardcoding if opcode == "⊕".
	•	All ops must resolve via registry.
	•	Allows us to evolve semantics without rewriting CPU code.

⸻

✅ So to answer your question:
We start with finalizing the base symbols/operators (Step 1) — that gives us a safe foundation.
Then we immediately fix the collision set (Step 2) so Codex + GlyphOS + Symatics don’t crash into each other.
Only after that do we wire CPU runtime and parsers (Steps 3–4).

🛠 Master Build Task Log (Cross-System)

🔴 Critical Path (must fix before Photon Algebra)
	1.	Namespace Enforcement
	•	Introduce domain prefixes in AST + registry (logic:⊗, physics:⊗, quantum:≐, photon:≈).
	•	Apply to all collisions: ⊗, ∇, ↔, ⊕, ⟲, ⧖, ≐.
	2.	Canonical Operator Registry
	•	Merge instruction_registry.py (CodexCore), symatics_rulebook.py, glyph_dispatcher.py, quantum_kernel.py.
	•	Single source of truth with: {symbol, domain, arity, semantics, handler}.
	3.	Canonicalization & Rewrite Unification
	•	Merge Symatics canonicalizer/normalize with CodexLang parser.
	•	Ensure rewrite rules produce consistent AST ({op, args}).
	4.	Entanglement Handling
	•	Centralize ↔ into entanglement manager (shared API).
	•	Codex runtime should delegate ↔ ops instead of tuple hacks.
	5.	Delay vs Collapse (⧖)
	•	Codex ⧖ = async delay, Quantum ⧖ = measurement collapse.
	•	Action: rename or tag (codex:delay, quantum:collapse).

⸻

⚠️ High Priority
	6.	Tensor vs Fuse (⊗) → disambiguate Codex physics tensor from Symatics fuse.
	7.	Gradient (∇) → unify compressor/damping semantics.
	8.	Equation Relation (≐) → tag as qm:≐ vs gr:≐.
	9.	Logic Chain (→) → clarify Codex chain vs logic implication.

⸻

🧰 Medium
	10.	Align metrics buses (CodexMetrics, Symatics.metrics, Glyph trace).
	11.	Documentation auto-generator (from canonical registry).
	12.	AST schema normalization (Codex parser ↔ Glyph parser ↔ Symatics rewrite).
