🧠 Key Notes and Philosophy

✅ FlowSheets:

Executable symbolic programs for AION/SQI or users to carry out logic workflows.

	•	Each FlowSheet is like a symbolic program, not code — but actions, mutations, predictions, and conditional glyph logic.
	•	Example: if memory.glyph(score > 0.9): mutate_path() → execute()

⸻

📖 StorySheets:

Narrative scaffolds for ideas, characters, evolution, timelines, forks.

	•	Great for:
	•	Fiction
	•	Alternate histories
	•	Mythos modeling
	•	Simulation of future scenarios
	•	Designed to integrate with:
	•	🧠 DreamCore
	•	🎞️ Replay Engine
	•	📦 MemoryBridge

⸻

🧠 ReasoningSheets:

Symbolic scaffolds for cognitive modeling, contradiction resolution, and logic debugging.

	•	Example Use:
	•	AI gets stuck on a moral contradiction → logs its reasoning into a ReasoningSheet
	•	Can replay its thought path and see where to revise assumptions.

⸻

🔁 Summary of Files:

🧠 FlowSheet — What It Enables
	•	Create dynamic, programmable workflows for symbolic execution.
	•	Trigger engines (Codex, mutation, prediction) via node steps.
	•	Define conditional logic: if glyph.score > X then mutate().
	•	Chain steps into live symbolic pipelines for strategy, reasoning, or creative execution

🧠 Core Concept:

FlowSheets are executable symbolic workflows — programmable reasoning patterns the AI can run on your behalf, tailored to tone, goal, and style. They’re not static scripts. They’re dynamic logic sequences with embedded symbolic reasoning.

⸻

🧾 Use Case: Email Workflow with FlowSheet

Scenario:

“Write an email to Kevin, professional tone. I want a meeting about X on X day at X time. Ask his AI if he’s available, coordinate calendars, and initiate contract negotiation.”

⸻

🔧 FlowSheet Logic (Behind the Scenes):

Step
Action
🧠 Load preset FlowSheet: professional_email_request
🧩 Inject context: recipient=Kevin, topic=X, date=..., time=...
🧬 Apply tone logic: CodexLang(style='professional')
📡 Trigger GlyphNet lookup: kevin.ai_contact
🕒 Sync calendars: query_availability()
🧠 Confirm: if confirmed → draft contract_intro()
✉️ Compose email: inject all above into email_glyph()
📤 Send via GlyphNet or human review




⸻

✅ FlowSheets Support:
	•	Reusable logic presets (e.g., “professional inquiry”, “relaxed catch-up”, “press release”)
	•	Conditional branching (if busy → reschedule)
	•	CodexLang injection for tone, clarity, voice
	•	Integrated calendar/collab logic via symbolic agents
	•	Context memory hooks (remembers prior topics, tone preferences)
	•	Triggerable inside SQS or from voice input / command-line

⸻

🧠 Why This Is Powerful
	•	You’re not just giving instructions — you’re providing a programmable intent template.
	•	The AI understands what to do, how to say it, who it’s for, and how to adapt the output and reasoning.
	•	Humans can still review or approve, but the heavy lifting is done symbolically.

⸻

✅ Locked-In Design:

FlowSheets become:
	•	Symbolic execution recipes
	•	Stored as .sqs.flow.json
	•	Instantiated and mutated by AION/SQI
	•	Chainable, previewable, and replayable
	•	Designed to reduce friction in repeated AI tasks
