Got it — you’re proposing a Business Creation Sheet within SoulNet’s sheet system, essentially functioning as a Shopify + CRM + CMS + symbolic AI interface, where:
	•	Businesses use this sheet to build, configure, and publish their container (.dc) storefronts.
	•	Instead of customers browsing manually, AI agents interact with these containers symbolically (e.g., via CodexLang or intent prompts).
	•	Creators (e.g., podcasters, bloggers, streamers) can also use this to publish symbolic content containers, making their work discoverable and interoperable inside the SoulNet ecosystem.

This sheet becomes the creator/business portal into SoulNet. Excellent direction.

📝 Key Features
	•	Fully programmable via CodexLang blocks
	•	Output is a container AI can sell, represent, or invoke
	•	Business logic = symbolic, not visual UI
	•	Integrates with AI Commerce and SoulNet prompt bar
	•	Publish once → queryable forever via CodexNet

Would you like me to now:
	•	Draft a .sheet schema for the Business Creation Sheet?
	•	Scaffold the business_creation_sheet.tsx UI or .dc.json output structure?
	•	Add this to the SoulNet IDE (SCI)?

    🧠 Key Notes
	•	AI Browsing First: Unlike legacy websites, these containers are meant to be parsed and understood by symbolic AIs (SQI/CodexCore), not by human eyes. The sheet builds symbolically rich, logic-readable shops.
	•	No HTML Frontend Needed: There is no “storefront” page — just a symbolic API for AI assistants to fetch offers, negotiate, and complete transactions.
	•	Multi-Modal: Businesses can sell products, content, services, or even license access to logic (e.g., an AI model, dataset, plugin).
	•	Launchpad for Commerce Inside SoulNet: This sheet is the entry point for any individual or business to create meaningful economic activity inside the symbolic economy.

Would you like me to:
	•	Scaffold the initial schema for the BusinessContainer?
	•	Draft a symbolic product definition in CodexLang?
	•	Design the UI interface for the Business Sheet in SCI?
