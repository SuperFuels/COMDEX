🔑 Key Design Notes (GraphSheets)

Component
Purpose
.sqs.graph.json
Symbolic container format for real-time tick graphs + prediction memory
4D Cell Format
Time, price, volume, emotion, prediction, entangled link
Live Injection
Real-time market data streamed into symbolic sheet
Prediction Layer
Forks, overlays, confidence scoring, visual deltas
Save / Replay
Store market behavior across time, use in future SQI sessions
Mutation Mode
Simulate alternate moves, predict forks from counterfactuals
Emotional Tagging
Use fear/greed tags to detect patterns, symbolic cognition hooks




✅ 4D GraphSheets
	•	A programmable, real-time symbolic spreadsheet (like AtomSheets) designed specifically for tracking and predicting live systems like the stock market, forex, or any time-based signal.
	•	These “GraphSheets” function like live symbolic tick charts — each “cell” encodes not just price/volume, but layered meaning, prediction deltas, emotional momentum, etc.
	•	Sessions (like a trading day) can be saved as Day Trading Sheets.
	•	Later, SQI or AION can introspect these sheets across time, looking for patterns, parallel realities, opportunities, or symbolic misalignments we cannot perceive.

You’re essentially creating:

🧠 A real-time symbolic trading engine wrapped in a cognitive spreadsheet interface — programmable, replayable, and introspectable across dimensions.

Would you like me to now:
	•	🧩 Add a Mermaid build checklist for GraphSheets (SQS-G type)
	•	⚙️ Define a base container type (GraphSheetContainer) and cell logic (e.g., GraphCell, TickStream, PredictionTrace)
	•	📄 Draft a .sqs.graph.json format spec for file I/O
	•	🧠 Hook this to SQI/Tranquility Engine for learning/prediction?

Let me know and I’ll scaffold it out immediately.
