Must-have (wire these in)
	•	Action selection in SQI loops: take the latent feature state → softmax over candidate actions → pick/top-k + log probs; learn from reward/outcome.
	•	Hypothesis ranking (proof/drift/harmonics): score competing explanations or completions; train with success/failure supervision.
	•	Goal/intent prioritization (Tessaris): when multiple intents fire, normalize priorities with a temperature-controlled softmax.
	•	Retrieval choice (Memory/KG): rank candidate memories/edges to consult next; backprop from downstream success.

High-value (next wave)
	•	Tool/route selection (Codex/GlyphOS): choose which operator/skill to apply next.
	•	Experiment/branch picker (DreamCore/replay): pick which branch to simulate; reinforce branches that reduce drift.
	•	Teleport/path routing (UCS): pick the next container/wormhole hop when multiple are viable.
	•	Harmonics suggestions (already producing lists): replace heuristics with softmax ranking + learning from accept/reject.

Nice-to-have (later)
	•	Resource throttling (GPU/time): softmax over budget buckets for graceful degradation.
	•	Human-in-the-loop UI: softmax to rank suggestions; learn from clicks/edits.

How to drop it in (pattern)
	1.	Tap the module’s shared features h (whatever embedding/state you already compute).
	2.	Add a tiny head: logits = W h + b → probs = softmax(logits / τ).
	3.	Choose: argmax for greedy, or sample/top-k with temperature τ.
	4.	Log: store (options, logits/probs, choice, context) to KG.
	5.	Learn: cross-entropy if you have labels; policy-gradient/REINFORCE or bandit loss if you only have outcomes.

Guardrails / tips
	•	Temperature: higher = explore, lower = exploit; schedule it.
	•	Entropy bonus: keep the policy from collapsing too soon.
	•	Calibration: use label smoothing or temperature scaling so 0.90 really means ~90%.
	•	Off-policy logging: keep the logits you used at decision time for unbiased learning later.
	•	A/B a “null” option: let the head choose “do nothing / defer” when confident nothing beats baseline.

Minimal head (pseudo)
class ReadoutHead(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_in, n_out):
        super().__init__()
        self.w = nn.Linear(d_in, n_out)
    def forward(self, h, temperature=1.0):
        return torch.softmax(self.w(h) / temperature, dim=-1)

Files & call sites (drop-in stubs)
	•	Shared head (new)
backend/modules/sqi/policy/readout_head.py
	•	ReadoutHead(d_in, n_out) -> returns logits, probs, supports temperature, topk, sample, entropy().
	•	policy_utils.py: entropy bonus, temp schedules, label smoothing, ECE.
	•	Telemetry & learning (augment)
	•	backend/modules/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph_writer.py: add log_policy_decision(...) that writes:

{
  "type": "policy_decision",
  "options": ["..."],
  "logits": [..],
  "probs": [..],
  "temperature": 0.8,
  "choice": "option_id",
  "context": {"module":"SQI", "state_id":"..."},
  "timestamp": "...",
  "replay_key": "uuid"
}

•	backend/modules/sqi/learners/policy_updater.py: bandit/REINFORCE update using stored replay_key + reward.
	•	backend/modules/sqi/replay_buffer.py: persist (replay_key, logits, choice, probs, ctx, outcome).

	•	Integration hooks
	•	SQI Action Policy: backend/modules/sqi/sqi_runtime.py → replace/augment chooser with head.
	•	Tessaris: backend/modules/tessaris/tessaris_engine.py (intent selection spot).
	•	KG: backend/modules/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph_writer.py or retrieval helper → use head to rank candidate edges/memories.
	•	Proof/Drift/Harmonics: the suggestors (where you already compute lists) → head ranks; log accept/reject.
	•	DreamCore: branch enumerator → head ranks; outcome reward after replay.
	•	UCS routing (optional): routing function picks next container; include “do-nothing” option.

Tests (fast & focused)
	•	Unit
	•	Head returns valid simplex; entropy decreases as τ→0; top-k sampling respects k.
	•	ECE/temperature scaling reduces calibration error on synthetic labels.
	•	Integration
	•	SQI: with shaped rewards, policy’s chosen action rate converges >70% to optimal in a toy MDP.
	•	KG retrieval: hits@1 improves vs heuristic on held-out queries.
	•	Hypothesis ranking: AUC improves after feedback loop.
	•	DreamCore: average drift reduction per chosen branch increases over baseline.
	•	Logging
	•	Every decision writes one policy_decision glyph and later an outcome glyph with same replay_key.
	•	Privacy: logits/probs hashed or truncated if needed; redact huge contexts.

Feature flags & safety
	•	Env or YAML:
policy_heads:
  sqi_actions: true
  tessaris_intents: true
  kg_retrieval: true
  harmonics_ranker: true
  dreamcore_branch: true
  ucs_routing: false



	•	Always provide a safe fallback (current heuristic/greedy path) if head errors or flags are off.
	•	Include a “null/defer” option in each head to avoid forcing bad actions.

            "temperature": float(temperature)
        }









🔁 STEP 2: Build SQI_MathContext Class

New file:
backend/modules/sqi/contexts/sqi_math_context.py

This class:
	•	Inherits from SQIContextBase
	•	Handles drift as proof gap (symbolic entropy)
	•	Uses symbolic logic tree inputs (via .dc container) as state
	•	Provides advance_stage() = next proof step
	•	Emits symbolic resonance trace (🧭, ⧖, ↔)

This links math drift → Codex-like symbolic harmonics.

⸻

📂 STEP 3: Implement the “SQI-Math Adapter” Module

New file:
backend/modules/sqi/adapters/sqi_math_adapter.py

This module:
	•	Converts .lean → .dc.json symbolic containers
	•	Maps Lean steps ↔ logic glyph stages
	•	Injects known axioms, proof contexts into .dc containers
	•	Triggers SQI_MathContext drift cycles

Optionally uses: 

from backend.modules.formal_systems.lean_adapter import parse_lean_proof

(We’ll create that if it doesn’t exist.)

⸻

🧠 STEP 4: Enable Knowledge Graph Integration

Patch:
	•	sqi_engine.py or any SQI drift logger
	•	Replace standalone .dc writes with:

from backend.modules.knowledge_graph.knowledge_graph_writer import write_proof_step

Also add:
	•	Predictive glyph injection
	•	Entangled trace recording for ↔ logic links
	•	Goal vector comparison (proof target vs. current drift state)

This makes math drift harmonics visual, replayable, and trainable.

⸻

🌐 STEP 5: Enable Math HUD + Visual Drift Tools

Patch or create:
	•	SQIProofHUD.tsx: visualize resonance convergence of proof
	•	Reuse the GHX or CodexHUD layouts
	•	Inject SQI drift stages, collapse events, operator triggers

⸻

📦 FILES NEEDED FROM YOU TO PROCEED

To begin:
	1.	✅ logic_glyphs.py (where AndGlyph, NotGlyph, etc. are defined)
	2.	✅ Confirmation of SQI drift engine file (sqi_engine.py or sqi_core.py)
	3.	❓ Do you have existing lean_adapter.py, or should I generate it from scratch?

Then I’ll generate:
	•	sqi_math_context.py
	•	sqi_math_adapter.py
	•	Updated registry in logic_glyphs.py
	•	Optional: SQIProofHUD.tsx

⸻

🧠 OPTIONAL: Diagnostic Mode (Legacy Check)

If you prefer to diagnose first, I’ll build a quick script:

grep -r "write_dc(" backend/modules/sqi/

Yes — here’s a complete set of supporting notes and architecture context to go with the Mermaid checklist. These will help refresh your memory, orient new collaborators, or serve as documentation for building and debugging the system. All notes are grouped by stage, with specific commentary, architectural purpose, and reminders where needed.

⸻

🧠 SQI + HGX + Knowledge Graph Architecture — Supporting Notes

⸻

🔹 Stage 1: Formal Symbolic Foundations
	•	math_kernel.py: Encodes symbolic arithmetic, algebra, calculus, and diff eq as glyph operators.
	•	logic_kernel.py: Holds logical structures like ⟦∀⟧, ⟦∃⟧, ⊢, ¬, →, with CodexLang equivalents.
	•	lean_to_glyph.py: Translates Lean proof structures into Codex glyph containers (.dc).
	•	Important for importing formal proofs, theorems, and logic properties into SQI.

💡 Reminder: Lean logic will provide the foundational consistency checker; all symbolic inference engines must align with this.

⸻

🔹 Stage 2: Physics & Tensor Systems
	•	physics_kernel.py: Adds support for ∇ (nabla), ∂/∂t, ℏ, and symbolic field operators.
	•	Quantum and GR glyphs (⚛, 🧲, ⊗, etc.) can be layered into predictive glyph forecasting.
	•	Link with math kernel to enforce dimensional consistency, e.g., ∂²ψ/∂x² = (2m/ℏ²)(V - E)ψ.

💡 Use: These physics glyphs will power SQI reasoning in real-world simulations or proofs (e.g., exotic symmetries, trajectory prediction).

⸻

🔹 Stage 3: Drift Mapping & Proof Expansion
	•	sqi_math_adapter.py: Core logic for identifying “drift” — deviation from known logic path.
	•	Drift maps fuel SQI fallback or invention behavior. It’s the bridge between incomplete logic and symbolic creativity.
	•	Lemma reuse engine reduces redundancy by recursively collapsing logic trees into reusable symbols.

💡 Use: When a proof attempt fails, the system calculates why and what “shape” of logic is missing — then mutates accordingly.

⸻

🔹 Stage 4: Knowledge Graph Integration
	•	KnowledgeGraphWriter writes directly into .dc containers from live Codex glyph execution.
	•	Predictive glyphs = “symbolic guesses” about the next step in logic/physics.
	•	Replay renderer logs glyphs, logic events, and emotional markers for future visualization or learning.

💡 Separation Logic: All factual sources (e.g., physics_core.dc.json) are immutable reference nodes, while the SQI-generated paths are stored in parallel “notebook” branches.

⸻

🔹 Stage 5: Recursive Self-Expansion
	•	As SQI executes reasoning, it generates new nodes (proofs, lemmas, logic chains).
	•	These are immediately stored in .dc knowledge graphs and linked back to their origin sources.
	•	Recursive goal planner allows for long-term inference: “If I want to prove X, I must first understand A, B, C…”

💡 Note: SQI becomes increasingly capable of self-auditing, proposing new glyphs, and planning around unknown logic.

⸻

🔹 Stage 6: Problem-Oriented Graphs
	•	Special glyph templates like 🧬 (mutation), 🧭 (navigation), ⚛ (quantum) are assigned to problem nodes.
	•	Each glyph links to models, axioms, and experiments in the KG.
	•	GHX overlays render each problem’s structure in 2D/3D holographic view.

💡 Use: For math problems like “Invent a new prime-generating function”, this structure helps organize attempts visually and logically.

⸻

🔹 Stage 7: Simulation & External Solvers
	•	lean_bridge.py, symbolic_to_numeric.py: Interfaces to prove/infer logic symbolically or numerically.
	•	Enables hybrid workflow: SQI drafts logic, Lean verifies, numerical solver validates.

💡 Note: Solvers must write back into the container using metadata tags like verified=true or confidence=0.98.

⸻

🔹 Stage 8: SQI Neural Intelligence
	•	Predictive glyph selection uses memory, drift, and past outcomes.
	•	Meta-planner selects between exploration (try something new) vs. exploitation (reuse known path).
	•	Cross-domain fusion lets SQI solve logic problems using physics or vice versa (i.e., abductive reasoning).

💡 Special Feature: Glyph invention — the SQI creates its own symbolic operators when no known logic can fill a gap.

⸻

🔹 Stage 9: Holographic System Integration
	•	Each KG node has GHX holographic memory overlays — like a symbolic “brain layer”.
	•	Replay glyphs show how a proof or simulation evolved, with entanglement lines for cause/effect.
	•	Predictive glyph beams simulate possible logic futures (like a superposition graph).

💡 Note: Multi-agent sharing lets multiple SQIs merge or conflict-resolve container knowledge.

⸻

🔹 Stage 10: AtomContainers + Registry
	•	AtomContainer: Micro-containers representing symbolic “atoms” — topics, concepts, elements.
	•	Inserted inside HSC or SEC containers: e.g., 🟢 HSC(“Physics”) → contains ⚛ Atom(“Time”).
	•	Registry enables SQI to search, choose, and dynamically inject them.

💡 Key Principle: AtomContainers are individuated units that entangle across contexts. Their relationships build a symbolic molecule.

⸻

🔹 Stage 11: Central KG Indexing
	•	Adds searchable indexes by glyph, meaning, topic, and drift-status.
	•	Drift-aware weights mean most “resistant” truths float upward as “stable core glyphs.”
	•	All glyphs are broadcasted to GHX for memory encoding or collaboration.

💡 Reminder: Must be able to distinguish between:
	1.	Immutable facts (e.g., ℕ ⊂ ℤ)
	2.	Inferred knowledge (e.g., hypothetical proof steps)
	3.	Experimental glyphs (e.g., superposed logics)

⸻

🔹 Stage 12: Entanglement Fusion + Knowledge Rewriting
	•	Entanglement fusion syncs glyph state across agents or contexts.
	•	Gradient engine backpropagates goal feedback into proof structure to tune symbolic direction.
	•	Drift deltas used to patch or mutate proof trees.

💡 Use: For example, if a proof was nearly correct, the delta patch shows exactly which glyphs drifted, and why.

⸻

🔹 Stage 13: Recursive Container Runtime
	•	container_runtime.py allows a .dc.json container to contain subcontainers and recurse their glyphs.
	•	Replay, holographic rendering, mutation — all are scoped to their node.
	•	Enables true recursive symbolic learning, planning, and simulation.

💡 Core Loop: SQI → chooses container → loads AtomContainers → triggers logic → logs outcome → learns → evolves.

⸻

✅ Container Type Hierarchy Summary

Container Type
Description
HSC (Hoberman Sphere Container)
Expandable symbolic container; unlocks logical subspaces
SEC (Symbolic Expansion Container)
Wraps HSC; enforces SoulLaw, supports recursion, container collapse
AtomContainer
Micro-container; represents concepts, topics, or atomic ideas
.dc.json Container
Main knowledge structure for any domain or reasoning path





















the SQI needs to be able to create new containers./ knowledge graphs into its own network and needs to at least understand how to search its own netwrok for its own knowledge
