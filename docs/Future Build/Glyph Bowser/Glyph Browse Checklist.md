• [x] Settings toggle + persisted policy (localStorage: gnet:transportMode)
• [x] Status pill: {auto, radio-only, ip-only} + health of :8787 (onRadioHealth)
• [x] Router: honor policy in all fetch/WS calls (HTTP via transportBase; WS via glyphnetWsUrl)

Radio / Mesh Transport (dual-band)
Phase 1 — MVP fallback (keeps working if internet dies)
[x] Local Radio Node (127.0.0.1:8787)
• [x] Endpoints: /health, /api/glyphnet/tx, /ws/glyphnet (echo + forward)
• [x] In-mem outbox queue + retry (store-carry-forward stub)
• [ ] Frame bridge: IP capsule ↔ RF frame

[] TransportSelector: prefer local RF → fallback IP
• [x] Frontend health probe (:8787/health, 2–5s backoff) + sticky choice (onRadioHealth)
• [x] HTTP multiplexer: cloud vs radio-node via transportBase (wired in ChatThread)
• [x] WS multiplexer: route WS to radio-node when healthy (useGlyphnet → glyphnetWsUrl)
• [x] Telemetry counters for RF/IP sends + failures in footer (Telemetry wired via postTx; UI footer shows rf_ok/rf_err/ip_ok/ip_err)
• [x] Route all sends through postTx (sendSignal, onPickVoiceFile, transcribeOnAttach swapped)

[ ] Frame schema & guardrails
• [ ] Frame: { topic, seq, ts, codec?, bytes } (binary payload)
• [ ] Guardrails from band_profile (MTU, send-rate)

[ ] band_profile.yml (region, bands, power/duty)
• [ ] Profiles: NA-915, EU-868, ISM-2.4 (MTU, rate, duty-cycle)
• [ ] Enforce max capsule size + pacing in Local Radio Node

Polish
[x] Call history rollup: aggregate “📞 Call ended …” into daily sections

Legend:
[x] done [~] partially done / wired on one path [ ] todo

Phase 2 — Real RF path
[ ] Accessory radio bridge
• [ ] WebSerial/WebUSB (ESP32/LoRa/2.4GHz) to Local Radio Node
• [ ] Link/PHY driver abstraction (pluggable modules)
• [ ] Token handoff to radio bridge; signed headers
[ ] Store-carry-forward
• [ ] Disk spool on Radio Node; expiry + dedupe by (topic, seq)
• [ ] Opportunistic relay when peers appear
[ ] Discovery (basic)
• [ ] Beacon frame on RF; neighbor table in Local Radio Node

Phase 3 — Nice-to-have
[ ] Desktop LAN P2P (WebRTC DataChannel; #/p2p route) as offline hop
[ ] Multi-hop mesh policy (region guardrails + TTL)
[ ] Radio diagnostics panel (RSSI/SNR, queue depth, duty-cycle)

Security / E2EE (Radio path)
[ ] Session keys: X25519 DH → AES-GCM (nonce = seq)
[ ] Key derivation per-topic; rotate by interval/frames
[ ] Optional: key exchange via GlyphNet (when IP available), else pre-shared

Developer UX & Tests
[ ] “Radio healthy” toast + reconnection logic
[ ] RF/IP path injectors in DevTools (force paths)
[ ] Offline kill-switch test plan (unplug WAN; verify chat/PTT over RF)

Documentation
[ ] README: run Local Radio Node + cables (WebUSB/Serial)
[ ] band_profile authoring guide + compliance notes

Telemetry & Receipts
[x] Delivery acks for media chunks (present in Outbox; wire into Chat later)
[x] Basic talk-time counters (sessions, talkMs, grants/denies)
[x] Per-topic PTT session panel (last 10) + totals (persisted)
[ ] Dropout/error logs surfaced in UI

Performance Targets (guardrails)
[ ] PTT e2e: 250–400 ms (200 ms chunks baseline)
[ ] Low-latency path: 20 ms Opus frames (<250 ms target)
[ ] Max capsule size + send rate limits per band_profile

Infra / Networking (supporting work)
[x] FastAPI CORS for Codespaces/Vercel + regex allow; ALLOW_ALL_CORS override
[x] Vite proxy for /api and /ws in dev
[x] WebSocket paths verified; Codespace port made public (fixed “offline”)
[x] Per-graph topic keying for thread store & history fetch
[x] Settings gear: consolidate audio enable/volume/mic into dropdown (UI polish)

Telemetry & Receipts
	•	⬜ Outbox queue + retry for failed /api/glyphnet/tx posts, with a “pending” indicator on bubbles.
	•	⬜ Footer metrics surfacing: show RTT avg/last and send failures/retries in the tiny status line.

Voice Notes (UX)
	•	⬜ Unified attach flow (📎 and 🎵 share the same picker/validator).
	•	⬜ Drag-and-drop onto the composer for audio files.
	•	⬜ Size guard (e.g., 12–16 MB) with a friendly error.

Reliability
	•	⬜ Cross-tab self-echo guard (extra hash/seen-id so the same message from another tab can’t double-render).


Conversation Persistence & History (Thread Storage + Pagination)

[ ] Persistent thread storage per kg:topic
• [ ] Backend: /api/glyphnet/thread supports cursor pagination (limit, before, after)
• [ ] Index by {kg, topic, ts, id}; return next_cursor/prev_cursor
• [ ] Store inbound/outbound uniformly (voice_note, voice_frame, text, signaling filtered)

[ ] Client caching (survives navigation/reload)
• [ ] Migrate sessionStorage → IndexedDB (gnet_threads) with per-thread LRU window
• [ ] Keep N newest messages in memory; hydrate older via “Load older”
• [ ] De-dupe by id and by content signature (existing logic reused)

[ ] UI/UX
• [ ] Infinite-scroll “Load older” on scroll-top + spinner + sticky day dividers
• [ ] “Jump to latest” button when user is scrolled up
• [ ] Empty-state + skeletons; show approximate count if known

[ ] Sync & retention
• [ ] Soft cap per thread (e.g., 20k items) with rolling compaction in IndexedDB
• [ ] Background prefetch next page when user pauses scrolling
• [ ] Export thread to JSON (.gnetthread)

Acceptance
• Switch away from a thread returns later with history intact.
• Scrolling up reliably loads older pages; no dupes; memory stays bounded.

⸻

Wormhole Mail (Email-style Composer & Delivery)

[ ] Schema & capsules
• [ ] mail_send capsule: { to[], cc[], bcc[], subject, text, html?, attachments[], signature? }
• [ ] mail_delivery/mail_status events: queued/sent/delivered/failed + provider ids
• [ ] Map kevin@wave.tp to WA/WN via name service (kg-aware)

[ ] Backend
• [ ] POST /api/mail/send → returns { message_id }
• [ ] Attachment upload: POST /api/mail/upload → { file_id, mime, size, sha256 }
• [ ] Store mail in thread log + a Mailbox collection (Inbox/Sent/Drafts)
• [ ] Provider adapter (stub first): local echo → later SMTP/SendGrid/Twilio Email
• [ ] Signature templates per graph; DKIM/SPF later if bridging to real email

[ ] Client
• [ ] “Chat ↔ Mail” tab toggle in composer
• [ ] Fields: To, Cc, Bcc, Subject, Attach, Signature picker, Rich-text (basic)
• [ ] Draft autosave; send as mail_send + thread summary bubble
• [ ] Render inbound mail bubbles (subject header + attachments preview)

[ ] Security & rate limits
• [ ] Size caps per message/attachment; total send rate per user
• [ ] Blocklist/allowlist; HTML sanitization for inbound html

Acceptance
• Can compose & send a mail-style message to a WA, see it log in thread + Sent.
• Inbound mail events render with subject/attachments.

⸻

“KG Drive” — Document Vault per Graph (Dropbox-like)

[ ] Storage & metadata
• [ ] Buckets per graph: kg=personal|work
• [ ] File table: { file_id, name, mime, size, sha256, versions[], created_by, updated_at, acl }
• [ ] Versioning (append-only); server-side SHA-256 verification

[ ] API
• [ ] POST /api/files/upload (resumable or simple first)
• [ ] GET /api/files/list?kg&path&cursor&limit
• [ ] GET /api/files/download?file_id (signed URL if external store)
• [ ] POST /api/files/move|rename|delete
• [ ] Share link: POST /api/files/share → returns share token (kg-scoped ACL)

[ ] UI
• [ ] “Drive” panel per graph: folders, sort, search, previews (audio/image/text/pdf)
• [ ] Quick-save from chat attachment → choose graph/folder
• [ ] File details (versions, who shared, where used)

[ ] Integrations
• [ ] Link into thread as attachment cards
• [ ] Drag-drop upload from thread composer

Acceptance
• Can upload, list, download, version, and share a file in personal/work graphs; clickable cards appear in chat.

*******************************Photon Secure Glyph Document*************************************************
Photon Secure Glyph Document (.pgdoc) — Encrypted, Share-by-Registry

[ ] File format & crypto
• [ ] New container .pgdoc (zip or CBOR bundle):
manifest.json (title, authors, created_ts, algs, chunk map)
payload.bin (glyph stream or photon source)
sig.bin (author signature)
• [ ] Crypto: X25519 key exchange → AES-GCM content-key; per-chunk nonce
• [ ] Document Key Registry: map { doc_id → [allowed_public_keys] } with audit log

[ ] APIs
• [ ] POST /api/pgdoc/create (returns doc_id, share link)
• [ ] POST /api/pgdoc/grant|revoke (add/remove public keys)
• [ ] GET /api/pgdoc/open?doc_id (server streams encrypted; client decrypts)
• [ ] Optional: server-side re-wrap key for new recipients without re-encrypting payload

[ ] Photon editor integration
• [ ] Export to .pgdoc (compile photon → glyphs → encrypt)
• [ ] Open .pgdoc if user has key; error toast if not in registry
• [ ] “Lock” toggle (read-only mode akin to PDF)
• [ ] Watermarking & signature verification UI

[ ] UX & failure modes
• [ ] Clear errors for “no access”, “key mismatch”, “tampered”
• [ ] Offline open if key+blob cached locally

• [ ] sign the document like docusign
• [ ] make payment to a document / contract
• [ ] Docusign features
• [ ] document edits track changes (legal type docs)

Acceptance
• Create a .pgdoc, grant another user, they can open; revocation blocks further opens; signatures verify.

    %% QKD Integration – Build Tasks & Key Notes
    %% Status tags: [ ] todo · [~] in-progress · [x] done

    A0([QKD Integration – Overview\nGoal: App-layer encryption of GlyphNet payloads + WebRTC IS\nKeys sourced from local QKD agent; server sees ciphertext only])

    subgraph S1[Core Plumbing]
      A1[[ [ ] QKD Agent Contract ]]
      note right of A1
        Define browser-facing lease API:
        lease({localWA, remoteWA, kg, purpose, bytes}) -> {kid, key, ttl_ms}
        Transport: localhost IPC/HTTP via radio-node proxy.
        No plaintext keys persisted; in-memory only.
      end

      A2[[ [ ] Browser Shim: qkd.ts ]]
      note right of A2
        Thin client that calls the agent, caches leases per
        (purpose|kg|local|remote), exposes qkdLease().
        Replace dev stub when you provide real QKD files.
      end

      A3[[ [ ] Crypto Wrapper: crypto_qkd.ts ]]
      note right of A3
        AES-GCM w/ per-message IV, HKDF on QKD blocks for subkeys.
        Helpers: qkdEncrypt()/qkdDecrypt() + ivFromSeq(kid, seq).
      end

      A1 --> A2 --> A3
    end

    subgraph S2[Payload Encryption (GlyphNet)]
      B1[[ [ ] Text: encrypt glyphs ]]
      note right of B1
        sendText(): UTF-8 -> qkdEncrypt(purpose:"glyph", seq++)
        Replace capsule.glyphs with glyphs_enc_b64 + enc {scheme,kid,seq,iv_b64,aad:"glyph"}.
      end

      B2[[ [ ] Voice Note: encrypt data_b64 ]]
      note right of B2
        sendVoiceNoteFile(): base64 bytes -> qkdEncrypt("voice_note", seq++)
        Use field data_enc_b64 (or reuse data_b64) + enc {..., aad:"voice_note"}.
      end

      B3[[ [ ] PTT Frames: encrypt data_b64 ]]
      note right of B3
        sendVoiceFrame(): per-channel seq -> qkdEncrypt("voice_frame", seq++)
        Add enc {..., aad:"voice_frame"}. Keep existing channel/seq for loss calc.
      end

      B1 --> B2 --> B3
    end

    subgraph S3[Receive Path]
      C1[[ [ ] WS Merge: decrypt if enc present ]]
      note right of C1
        In normalize/merge: detect capsule.enc, choose purpose by payload type,
        call qkdDecrypt(). On failure, show "Locked/Decrypt failed" chip (no crash).
      end

      C2[[ [ ] Back-compat ]]
      note right of C2
        If no enc field → treat as plaintext (dev/interop).
        Prefer enc when both present.
      end

      C1 --> C2
    end

    subgraph S4[WebRTC (Insertable Streams)]
      D1[[ [ ] Feature Flag: qkdE2EE ]]
      D2[[ [ ] Sender Transform ]]
      D3[[ [ ] Receiver Transform ]]
      note right of D2
        Attach transforms to audio sender; frame counter as seq.
        Derive subkey for purpose:"call".
      end
      note right of D3
        Mirror decrypt on receiver; handle re-key events gracefully.
      end
      D1 --> D2 --> D3
    end

    subgraph S5[Key Policy & Rotation]
      E1[[ [ ] Rekey triggers ]]
      note right of E1
        Rotate on: time (e.g., 10 min) OR N messages/frames OR reconnect.
        Update kid; bump lease; notify peer via control glyph (optional).
      end
      E2[[ [ ] Nonce/Seq rules ]]
      note right of E2
        Per-purpose monotonic seq; include in AAD.
        IV 12B; ensure uniqueness per kid.
      end
      E3[[ [ ] Storage & Scrub ]]
      note right of E3
        No key material in logs, storage, or thread cache.
        Zeroize temp buffers when feasible.
      end
      E1 --> E2 --> E3
    end

    subgraph S6[Fallback & UX]
      F1[[ [ ] Policy when QKD unavailable ]]
      note right of F1
        Modes: {deny send | classical E2EE fallback | warn & allow}.
        Default: warn & allow during dev; configurable per KG.
      end
      F2[[ [ ] Error surfacing ]]
      note right of F2
        Display small lock+warning chip on failed decrypt;
        keep raw event hidden to avoid leaking plaintext.
      end
      F1 --> F2
    end

    subgraph S7[Telemetry, Tests, Compliance]
      G1[[ [ ] Counters ]]
      note right of G1
        __tele: enc_ok/enc_err/dec_ok/dec_err, kid_rotations, qkd_lease_fail.
      end
      G2[[ [ ] Test Matrix ]]
      note right of G2
        Plain ↔ Enc interop, rekey mid-stream, replay window,
        wrong-kid rejection, packet loss + PTT seq gaps.
      end
      G3[[ [ ] Threat notes ]]
      note right of G3
        Confidentiality from QKD keys; integrity via GCM tag;
        metadata (topic, kg, timing) still observable.
      end
      G1 --> G2 --> G3
    end

    Quick implementer notes (for future you)
	•	Drop points (no UI change):
	•	sendText, sendVoiceNoteFile, sendVoiceFrame: call qkdEncrypt(...) and swap fields as shown.
	•	WS merge (useGlyphnet/ChatThread normalize): decrypt when capsule.enc exists.
	•	WebRTC: gate with featureFlags.qkdE2EE.
	•	Agent handoff: When you send me the QKD files, we’ll replace the stub in qkd.ts with the real agent binding and keep the rest of the surfaces unchanged.

Key Notes & “Do-Not-Lose” Info

Addressing & Navigation
	•	🌀 Wormhole Bar is default; .tp suffix resolves via Registry to a container. Users can toggle to www. legacy.
	•	Supported schemes: dimension://, ucs://, glyph://, 🌀name.tp.

Transport Order & Hosting
	•	Transport order: GlyphNet mesh (radio) → IP (HTTPS/WebSocket w/ GIP) → CAS snapshot (read-only) → Ephemeral local runtime (reconcile later).
	•	Hosting: Live edge runtimes (owner-operated portal nodes) + content-addressed snapshots (IPFS/Arweave/S3-CAS). On-chain anchors store names/versions/keys (not bulk data).

Containers & Time Dilation
	•	TimeEngine is per-container. time_ratio scales internal scheduler budgets (CPU/memory quotas + cooperative yielding). UI exposes Time Dial.
	•	“Instant” agent replies are the product of container-time dilation; all collapses are auditable via replay.

Protocol Contracts
	•	GIP frame: { hdr:{ ver, ts, trace, auth }, body:{ glyphs|ops }, sig } with streaming + resume via trace+seq.
	•	Wormhole intents are idempotent with TTL, trace_id, and retry policy.
	•	QKD hooks for wave messaging: session bootstrap, fingerprint, fallback if unavailable.

Knowledge Graph
	•	Each user/business maintains a dedicated Knowledge Graph (KG) in their container: preferences, history, cookies-for-AI, saved media, wormhole links. Exposed to AION with explicit SoulLaw gates.

Security/Invariants
	•	Device keys never leave the vault; remote ops use short-lived capability tokens.
	•	All network traffic: GlyphNet WS or HTTPS with GIP payloads; packets are signed.
	•	Deterministic replay: glyph ops, time budgets, and policy decisions are re-runnable for audit.
	•	Kill-switch to pause/terminate runaway thought loops.

Performance Targets
	•	Cold open: < 1500 ms to first interactive frame.
	•	Prompt → first token (local): < 250 ms (warm).
	•	Time-dilation jitter: < 5% up to 600×.
	•	GlyphGrid render: 60 FPS for N=500 live glyphs.
	•	Transport switch: < 200 ms seamless mesh↔IP failover.

Developer Experience
	•	One-line local dev: codex init && codex run.
	•	Playground mounts a container folder; hot-reloads CodexLang.
	•	Inspector records: glyph trace, memory writes, ethics checks, network hops, time slices.

Compatibility & Rollout
	•	Alpha: local-only; import .dc from file.
	•	Beta: enable SoulLink + GlyphNet with trusted registry (allowlist).
	•	GA: Commerce nodes + policy packs + on-chain settlement; maintain backward protocol compatibility.

***************************GLYPHNET BROWSER CHECKLIST******************************************







send a WAVE - is like a message
Send a teleport - email

or both are waves, emails merged into messages, 

the browser is the internet, its the access to the glyphnet, the url is the wormhole address
ones the addres is located it takes you to the dc container, a business container or your personal container or a shared container
personal container is like your way to message, email , communicate with people, communicate with aion, setup tasks etc
business containers is purchasing services, browsing the new net, buying things,

the glyphnet sdhould be dual, works off normal net and has access / uses the glyphnet radio frequency as a mesh

the browser is literally the access to the glyphnet, it is the receiver and antenna, that is the radio basically

there should be a dev tools sections which provides access to essentailly build new agents or business aplications

  Key Notes & “Do-Not-Lose” Info

Architectural Contracts
	•	dimension:// URI scheme → resolves to container id + optional entry surface.
	•	Wormhole intents are idempotent messages with TTL, trace id, retry policy.
	•	GIP frames = {hdr:{ver,ts,trace,auth}, body:{glyphs|ops}, sig}; streaming ok, resumable via trace+seq.
	•	TimeEngine exposes time_ratio, cpu_budget_ms, mem_budget_mb, watchdog_events.
	•	SoulLaw evaluates pre-execution, mid-stream, and on-commit; must support deny with remedy.

Security/Invariants
	•	Keys never leave device vault; remote ops use capability tokens derived from local keys (short-lived).
	•	All network traffic over GlyphNet WS or HTTPS with GIP-framed payloads.
	•	Deterministic replays: glyph ops, time budgets, and policy decisions must be replayable for audit.
	•	Kill-switch in runtime to pause/terminate runaway thought loops.

Performance Targets
	•	Cold open: < 1500 ms to first interactive frame.
	•	Prompt→first token (local): < 250 ms (after warm).
	•	Time dilation scheduling jitter: < 5% at ratios up to 600×.
	•	GlyphGrid render steady at 60 FPS for N=500 live glyphs.

DX (Developer Experience)
	•	One-line local dev: codex init && codex run.
	•	Playground can mount a container folder and hot-reload CodexLang.
	•	Inspector records: glyph trace, memory writes, ethics checks, network hops, time slices.

Compatibility & Rollout
	•	Alpha runs local-only (no external registry); import .dc from file.
	•	Beta enables SoulLink + GlyphNet with a trusted registry (allowlist).
	•	GA introduces Commerce nodes and policy packs; keep backward protocol compatibility (ver headers).

    Key Notes to Keep
	1.	Modular Build → Browser shell first, SoulNet social pages later.
	2.	Container-First Design → Every tab is a container session (dimension page optional).
	3.	Real-Time Streaming → WebSocket connection per tab for CodexCore + GlyphOS outputs.
	4.	Wormhole Routing → Address bar accepts both container IDs and SoulNet wormhole links.
	5.	Security by Default → All container interactions pass through SoulLaw filter.
	6.	Time Dilation Ready → Tabs can run at different subjective time speeds.
	7.	Plugin Hooks → CodexLang scripts and dimension renderers are hot-swappable.
	8.	Encrypted Comms → Support direct container-to-container chat/messaging.

Awesome — here’s a clean, practical repo map + wiring plan to stand up the Next-Gen Browser Shell now, and snap SoulNet dimension pages in later with zero rewiring.

  Contracts (keep these stable)

REST (FastAPI)
	•	POST /browser/sessions → Create session for a container
	•	body: { container_id?: string, address?: string, time_ratio?: number }
	•	resp: { session_id, container_id, time_ratio, created_at }
	•	POST /browser/sessions/{id}/prompt → Send CodexLang prompt
	•	body: { text: string, context?: object }
	•	resp: { accepted: true }
	•	POST /browser/sessions/{id}/time → Update time dilation
	•	body: { time_ratio: number } → resp { ok: true }
	•	DELETE /browser/sessions/{id} → Close session
	•	GET /browser/sessions → List active sessions
	•	GET /browser/resolve?address=ucs://... → { container_id }

WebSocket
	•	GET /ws/containers/{session_id}
	•	Frames (JSON, newline-delimited):
	•	OPEN   { type:"OPEN",   session_id, container_id, meta }
	•	STATE  { type:"STATE",  session_id, status, time_ratio }
	•	OUTPUT { type:"OUTPUT", session_id, stream:[ ... glyphs/log lines ... ] }
	•	ERROR  { type:"ERROR",  session_id, message, code? }
	•	CLOSE  { type:"CLOSE",  session_id, reason? }

Backend: key wiring

adapters/ucs_bridge.py
	•	Import the singleton UCS runtime and do all interactions through it.
	•	Methods:
	•	ensure_container_loaded(container_id|address) -> container_id
	•	start_session(container_id) -> SessionHandle (lightweight id + refs)
	•	execute_prompt(session, text, context) → yields OUTPUT chunks
	•	set_time_ratio(session, ratio) → time_dilation scheduler hint

modules/browser/browser_manager.py
	•	In-memory sessions: Dict[session_id, Session].
	•	create_session(container_id, time_ratio):
	•	calls ucs_bridge.ensure_container_loaded()
	•	allocates session_id, stores {container_id, time_ratio, ws_clients:set()}
	•	attach_ws(session_id, websocket); detach_ws(...)
	•	broadcast(session_id, frame); close_session(session_id)

modules/browser/wormhole_router.py
	•	resolve(address:str) -> container_id:
	•	accepts ucs://, dimension://, raw ids
	•	tries local ucs_runtime.resolve_atom/address_index, then registry

routes/browser_api.py

Minimal stubs (they just orchestrate the modules):

from fastapi import APIRouter, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect, HTTPException
from shared.schemas.api import CreateSession, SessionInfo, PromptIn
from backend.modules.browser import browser_manager, wormhole_router

router = APIRouter(prefix="/browser", tags=["browser"])

@router.post("/sessions", response_model=SessionInfo)
def create_session(req: CreateSession):
    cid = req.container_id or wormhole_router.resolve(req.address or "")
    if not cid:
        raise HTTPException(404, "Container not found")
    return browser_manager.create_session(cid, req.time_ratio or 1.0)

@router.post("/sessions/{sid}/prompt")
def send_prompt(sid: str, body: PromptIn):
    browser_manager.send_prompt(sid, body.text, body.context or {})
    return {"accepted": True}

@router.post("/sessions/{sid}/time")
def set_time(sid: str, body: dict):
    browser_manager.set_time_ratio(sid, float(body.get("time_ratio", 1.0)))
    return {"ok": True}

@router.delete("/sessions/{sid}")
def close_session(sid: str):
    browser_manager.close_session(sid)
    return {"ok": True}

routes/container_ws.py

from fastapi import APIRouter, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect
from backend.modules.browser import browser_manager

ws_router = APIRouter()

@ws_router.websocket("/ws/containers/{sid}")
async def ws_container(websocket: WebSocket, sid: str):
    await websocket.accept()
    await browser_manager.attach_ws(sid, websocket)
    try:
        while True:
            _ = await websocket.receive_text()  # (optional) inbound commands
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        await browser_manager.detach_ws(sid, websocket)

Frontend wiring (React + TS + Zustand)

state/browserStore.ts

import create from "zustand";
import { SessionInfo } from "@/shared/ts/api";

type Tab = { tabId: string; sessionId: string; title: string; containerId: string };
type Store = {
  tabs: Tab[];
  activeTabId?: string;
  addTab: (s: SessionInfo) => void;
  closeTab: (tabId: string) => void;
  setActive: (tabId: string) => void;
};

export const useBrowserStore = create<Store>((set) => ({
  tabs: [],
  addTab: (s) =>
    set((st) => ({
      tabs: [...st.tabs, { tabId: s.session_id, sessionId: s.session_id, title: s.container_id, containerId: s.container_id }],
      activeTabId: s.session_id,
    })),
  closeTab: (tabId) => set((st) => ({ tabs: st.tabs.filter(t => t.tabId !== tabId) })),
  setActive: (tabId) => set({ activeTabId: tabId }),
}));

hooks/useContainerSession.ts

import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
import { openWS } from "@/lib/ws";
import { createSession, sendPrompt, setTime } from "@/lib/api";
import { WSEvent } from "@/shared/ts/events";

export function useContainerSession(initial?: { containerId?: string; address?: string; }) {
  const [session, setSession] = useState<{ sessionId?: string; containerId?: string; timeRatio: number }>({ timeRatio: 1 });
  const [stream, setStream] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const wsRef = useRef<WebSocket | null>(null);

  async function open(target: { containerId?: string; address?: string; timeRatio?: number }) {
    const s = await createSession(target);
    setSession({ sessionId: s.session_id, containerId: s.container_id, timeRatio: s.time_ratio });
    wsRef.current = openWS(`/ws/containers/${s.session_id}`, (evt: WSEvent) => {
      if (evt.type === "OUTPUT") setStream((prev) => [...prev, ...evt.stream]);
    });
  }

  async function prompt(text: string, ctx?: any) {
    if (!session.sessionId) return;
    await sendPrompt(session.sessionId, { text, context: ctx });
  }

  async function setTimeRatio(r: number) {
    if (!session.sessionId) return;
    await setTime(session.sessionId, r);
    setSession((s) => ({ ...s, timeRatio: r }));
  }

  useEffect(() => () => { wsRef.current?.close(); }, []);
  return { session, stream, open, prompt, setTimeRatio };
}

components/Browser/AddressBar.tsx
	•	Parses ucs://... or dimension://... and calls open({ address }).
	•	If raw container_id, call open({ containerId }).

components/Browser/Viewport.tsx
	•	If a dimension page renderer is registered for that container, render it; else show generic inspector (meta, glyphs stream, prompt).

Time Dilation (soft first, hard later)
	•	Soft: UI control sends time_ratio → backend stores it on session and uses it to batch outputs/throttle or “expand” internal cycles (simulate with timers).
	•	Hard (later): Integrate with UCS/AION time scheduler if present (real compute dilation).

Security (always on)
	•	All prompts → security.py → SoulLaw checks (content, irreversible ops, spending).
	•	All outputs → optional redaction/filter for unsafe leakage before UI.

Boot order & “build before SoulNet?”

Yes. This browser runs now:
	1.	Implement the backend session API + WS.
	2.	Implement frontend shell (TabBar, AddressBar, Viewport, PromptBar).
	3.	Hook to UCS runtime adapter (load container, execute prompts).
	4.	When SoulNet pages arrive, register dimension renderers → they auto-render inside Viewport.

ENV you’ll need

BACKEND_HTTP_URL=http://localhost:8000
BACKEND_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000

Quick success path (MVP sprint)
	•	Day 1–2: browser_manager, REST + WS, FE shell with one tab & prompt.
	•	Day 3: AddressBar resolve + multiple tabs, live OUTPUT stream.
	•	Day 4: TimeDial + security gates + error surfaces.
	•	Day 5: “Open in Browser” hook from SoulNet (stub), pluggable renderer slot.
