ðŸ”Ž Key Takeaways
	1.	CodexLang symbols = untouched (logic operators).
	2.	GlyphOS symbols = structural metadata, no overlap with algebra.
	3.	Symatics = resonance primitives (superpose, fuse, collapse, broadcast).
	4.	Photon Algebra =
	â€¢	Adopts all Symatics ops (safe alignment).
	â€¢	Shares some Codex ops (Â¬).
	â€¢	Resolves conflict (â†”) by aliasing â†’ âˆž.
	â€¢	Introduces new unique ops (Î», Î¨).

ðŸ‘‰ Next step: I can generate a conflict detector script so that when you add new glyphs/operators to Photon, Symatics, or Codex, the system automatically reports overlaps before they become a problem.

Would you like me to draft that validator script now?
