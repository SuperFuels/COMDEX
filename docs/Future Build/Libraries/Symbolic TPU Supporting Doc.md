1. Overview

sTPU ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) defines symbolic instructions for tensor algebra.
Unlike binary ISAs (x86, RISC-V, TPU v4), each instruction is a glyph carrying semantic meaning and meta-flags.
	â€¢	Operands: Symbolic Tensors (STensor) stored in Glyph Memory (entangled 4D AtomSheets).
	â€¢	Execution: Instructions may collapse into classical FLOPs or expand into entangled beam operations.
	â€¢	Flags: Each op updates not just numeric results but also symbolic metadata:
	â€¢	âˆ‡ Entropy Flag â†’ change in uncertainty.
	â€¢	â†” Entanglement Flag â†’ new links formed between tensors.
	â€¢	âœ¦ Milestone Flag â†’ SQI thresholds crossed.
	â€¢	âŸ² Mutation Flag â†’ if symbolic mutation occurred.
	â€¢	âŠ™ Collapse Flag â†’ indicates tensor collapsed from superposition.
