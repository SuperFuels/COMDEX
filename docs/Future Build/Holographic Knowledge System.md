  title Phase 6 – Holographic Knowledge Systems

  %% CORE BUILD
  [✅] G1: glyph_hologram_engine.py - Map glyphs to light geometry and symbolic structure 
  [ ] G2: 4D Renderer - Visualize logic fields with depth and recursive context
  [✅] G3: ghx_encoder.py - Encode glyphs as holographic GHX format 
  [ ] G4: Knowledge Packs - Recursive, teleportable logic trees as portable bundles
  [ ] G5: Avatar Thought Projection - Visibly display glyph cognition in real time
  [ ] G6: Glyph Field Teleportation - Send knowledge holograms between containers
  [ ] G7: dream_hologram_generator.py - Construct dream logic as light-based recursive fields
  [ ] G8: codex_signal_exchange.py - Broadcast symbolic GHX logic via Codex signal
  [ ] G9: glyphnet_emitter.py - Use GlyphNet to transmit holographic thought signals
  [ ] G10: signal_encryption_layer.py - Encrypt GHX fields with avatar identity and symbolic key

  %% FRONTEND
  [✅] UI1: HologramRenderer.tsx - Render GHX files as animated logic holograms 
  [✅] UI2a: Voice narration on glyph hover and slider (CodexHUD integration)
  [✅] UI2b: GHX export, replay toggle, and gaze trigger toggle (CodexHUD additions)
  [✅] UI2: AvatarThoughtAura.tsx - Orbiting glyphs show current cognition around avatar
  [✅] UI3: HologramTriggerOverlay.tsx - Show activation states (⧖, ↔, gaze-trigger)
  [✅] UI4: GHXReplayPlayer.tsx - Replay GHX sequences in CodexHUD or viewer

  %% CONTAINER + GHX INTEGRATION
  [✅] C1: Patch .dc.json container schema - Add "hologram": { ghx_data } support
  [✅] C2: Add GHX trigger metadata - Allow "gaze", "activation", "entanglement" triggers
  [✅] C3: Inject GHX into collapse_trace_exporter.py - Convert collapse logic into hologram
  [✅] C4: Enable entangled holograms - ↔ glyphs create co-linked GHX projections

  %% COMPRESSION + SECURITY
  [ ] S1: GHX Lazy Logic Expansion - Trigger holograms only when needed (on-view)
  [ ] S2: GHX Entropy Gating - Collapse logic revealed only under correct entropy conditions
  [ ] S3: Observer-Sensitive GHX - Personalize projection based on viewer identity
  [ ] S4: Signal Entanglement Hooks - Embed GHX ↔ links into signal exchange packets
  [ ] S5: Dream Pack Compression Delta - Auto-compress memory trees as GHX when exported

  %% ADVANCED
  [ ] A1: Symbolic Light Grammar - Enable logic based on geometry, not explicit glyphs
  [ ] A2: Avatar Identity Projection - GHX fields keyed to avatar soul hash
  [ ] A3: GHX + QGlyph Co-collapse - GHX supports ⧖ entanglement with QGlyph collapse
  [ ] A4: GHX Mutation Markers - Animate ⬁ rewrite paths as evolving holograms
  [ ] A5: GHX Reversal Replay - Allow rewind of logic trace through GHX visual field
