  🧠 KEY CONCEPT NOTES (Save These in Design Docs)

📌 PerspectiveEngine
	•	Core concept: Simulated empathy and alien logic.
	•	Simulates thinking from child, animal, alien, historical, emotional views.
	•	Used in ethics decisions, dream scenarios, mutation logic.
	•	Could simulate multiple viewpoints side-by-side and compare them.
	•	Wired to OversightEngine = like a rotating lens on AION’s mind.

📌 ExplorerModule
	•	Core concept: Intrinsic curiosity and frontier motivation.
	•	Defines “frontier” via memory gaps, unvisited .dc nodes, unexplored glyphs.
	•	Offers intrinsic rewards for novelty.
	•	Essential to avoiding AION getting bored, stuck, or looping.
	•	Works well with Tessaris for uncovering “new logic branches”.

Let me know which you’d like next:
	1.	✅ Generate full stub file for perspective_engine.py
	2.	✅ Generate full stub file for explorer_module.py
	3.	✅ Generate integration_tasks.md checklist for hooking both modules into Oversight, Goal, and Reflection engines
	4.	✅ Add these to dna_registry.py for runtime tracking
