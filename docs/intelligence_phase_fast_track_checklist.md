# Intelligence Phase Fast-Track Checklist

## 1. Core Infrastructure & Foundations
- [ ] Finalize Memory Engine with vector embeddings (basic functional)
- [ ] Implement Milestone Tracker fully integrated for skill unlocking
- [ ] Build and test Boot Selector for dynamic skill loading
- [ ] Set up Privacy Vault with secure access controls
- [ ] Ensure Scheduler reliably triggers Dream cycles, Goal loops, Skill boots

## 2. Consciousness Core Modules
- [ ] Complete DreamCore with full context integration (identity, situational, emotions, ethics)
- [ ] Implement Situational Engine fully wired to DreamCore and Decision Engine
- [ ] Finalize Decision Engine with goal prioritization and autonomy
- [ ] Complete Personality Profile linked to DreamCore & Decision Engine
- [ ] Finalize Reflection Engine for analyzing dream output and updating traits

## 3. Skill Evolution & Autonomy
- [ ] Build Skill Evolution & Mutation Engine triggered by milestones
- [ ] Implement Milestone-Triggered Autonomy fully integrated with scheduler and DreamCore

## 4. Data & Persistence
- [ ] Set up Database models for Dream, Skill, Milestone, Memory, Event with CRUD and relations
- [ ] Implement minimal Embedding & Vector DB integration for semantic search/compression

## 5. Frontend & Interaction
- [ ] Build minimal AION Terminal UI for querying AION and visualizing personality, milestones, goals
- [ ] Implement real-time updates for dreams, milestones, and skill boots via polling or SSE

## 6. External LLM Integration (Bridging to Future Local LLM)
- [ ] Plug in External LLM (GPT-4 or GPT4All) with abstraction layer for querying and prompt building
- [ ] Structure code for easy LLM swapping or augmentation with local models later

---

# Deferred Tasks (To be implemented after Intelligence Phase foundation)
- [ ] Advanced embedding compression and semantic threading (implement minimal viable version only)
- [ ] Complex tokenomics & wallet integration for AI energy
- [ ] Full real-time UI with WebSocket (use polling initially)
- [ ] Sophisticated logging and monitoring dashboards (keep basic logs now)
- [ ] Detailed skill dependency graphs and manual skill management UIs

---

# Priority Summary
- [ ] Establish core autonomous feedback loop: Dream → Milestone → Skill Evolution → Updated Dream
- [ ] Ensure scheduler triggers autonomous cycles reliably
- [ ] Implement modular swappable LLM interface for current GPT and future local LLM
- [ ] Provide minimal UI for essential interaction and monitoring
