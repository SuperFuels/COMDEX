\begin{abstract}
The Tessaris Ψ-series investigates how phase coherence can emerge, propagate, and self-stabilize within distributed photon-algebra lattices. Across Ψ₁–Ψ₄, we demonstrate that a collection of locally coupled oscillators governed by algebraic rewrite dynamics can spontaneously align their phases, form global coherence, and maintain stability through adaptive feedback. This establishes an algebraically consistent model of self-organizing coherence—a core mechanism for higher-order Tessaris dynamics.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The Tessaris framework defines a complex associative $\ast$-algebra used to model coupled dynamical systems. Within this structure, the coherence functional
\[
\Phi(\psi) = \langle \psi^\dagger C_+ \psi \rangle_0
\]
acts as a conserved quantity under unitary evolution and a self-measure of alignment in non-unitary regimes.
The Ψ-series explores how this functional behaves when extended across lattices of interacting observers.

Each stage of the Ψ-series builds conceptually:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ψ₁}: Multi-observer phase initialization
    \item \textbf{Ψ₂}: Lattice coherence propagation
    \item \textbf{Ψ₃}: Spatial interference cascade
    \item \textbf{Ψ₄}: Coherence feedback stabilization
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Framework}
Each observer $\psi_j$ evolves under photon-algebra dynamics:
\[
\dot{\psi}_j = iH \psi_j + \eta \Gamma(t, \Phi) \sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(j)} (\psi_k - \psi_j),
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H$ is the local phase Hamiltonian,
    \item $\eta$ is the propagation rate,
    \item $\Gamma(t,\Phi)$ is the adaptive coupling coefficient,
    \item $\mathcal{N}(j)$ denotes the nearest neighbors of observer $j$.
\end{itemize}

The feedback law is defined as:
\[
\Gamma(t,\Phi) = \Gamma_0 \big[1 + \kappa (\Phi_\text{target} - \Phi(t)) \big],
\]
producing self-regulating coherence stabilization analogous to biological homeostasis or control feedback in nonlinear systems.

\section{Ψ₁ — Multi-Observer Phase Initialization}
The initial phase experiment initializes a small group of observers ($N=5$) with random phase states:
\[
\psi_j(0) = e^{i\theta_j}, \quad \theta_j \sim U(-\pi, \pi).
\]
Each evolves under uniform coupling until phase differences vanish.
The result demonstrates that the photon-algebra rules allow observers to reach a shared baseline phase.

\textbf{Verified results:}
\[
\Phi_\text{mean} = 0.9999999999999948, \quad \sigma_\text{final} \approx 5.2\times10^{-15}.
\]
State: fully synchronized observer lattice.  
Visualization (\texttt{Tessaris\_Ψ1\_MultiObserverPhaseInit.png}) shows rapid convergence of all phase traces toward a normalized steady-state.

\section{Ψ₂ — Lattice Coherence Propagation}
Ψ₂ extends this process to a one-dimensional lattice of 25 observers:
\[
\psi_j(t+1) = \psi_j(t) + \eta \Gamma \sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(j)} (\psi_k - \psi_j).
\]
The coherence functional $\Phi = |\langle e^{i\theta_j}\rangle|$ is tracked over time.
At moderate coupling ($\Gamma = 0.75$), coherence initially rises then decays to zero, showing that pure diffusion cannot sustain global alignment.

\textbf{Verified results:}
\[
\Phi_\text{final} = 0.000637, \quad \sigma_\text{phase} = 1.81.
\]
This defines a lower bound $\Gamma_c$ for stable propagation.

\section{Ψ₃ — Spatial Interference Cascade}
Ψ₃ expands to a $20\times20$ 2D lattice with periodic boundaries.
Strong coupling ($\Gamma = 1.15$) induces a spatial coherence cascade, where local phase clusters merge into a globally synchronized field:
\[
\Phi_\text{final} = 0.999998, \quad \sigma_\text{phase} = 1.76\times10^{-3}.
\]
The final phase map (\texttt{Tessaris\_Ψ3\_InterferenceCascade\_Heatmap.png}) reveals coherent interference fringes with near-zero variance.
This demonstrates emergent global order from local algebraic rules.

\section{Ψ₄ — Coherence Feedback Stabilization}
Ψ₄ introduces dynamic feedback:
\[
\Gamma(t+1) = \Gamma(t) + \kappa (\Phi_\text{target} - \Phi(t)),
\]
where $\kappa$ controls responsiveness.
The lattice adapts coupling strength to maintain $\Phi \approx 1$ even under injected noise.

\textbf{Verified results:}
\[
\Phi_\text{final} = 0.9915, \quad \Gamma_\text{final} = 0.991, \quad \text{iterations} = 470.
\]
Plots (\texttt{Tessaris\_Ψ4\_CoherenceFeedback.png}) show reciprocal evolution of $\Phi$ (rising) and $\Gamma$ (falling) toward equilibrium.
The phase field snapshot confirms stability amid microscopic fluctuations.

\section{Interpretation (Plain Summary)}
Across Ψ₁–Ψ₄, the Tessaris lattice transitions from isolated local phases to a coherent, self-regulating field:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ψ₁: Local agents learn a shared rhythm.  
    \item Ψ₂: Coherence diffuses and can decay without sufficient coupling.  
    \item Ψ₃: Strong coupling yields full synchronization—global coherence.  
    \item Ψ₄: Adaptive feedback keeps the system coherent under noise.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
\emph{A network of simple oscillators, following photon-algebra rules, can spontaneously organize itself into a coherent and stable state—and maintain it adaptively under perturbation.}
\end{quote}

This is a mathematical demonstration of emergent order and adaptive stability in distributed systems.

\section{Conclusion}
The Ψ-series establishes that Tessaris photon algebra supports four key capabilities:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Spontaneous synchronization} (Ψ₁)
    \item \textbf{Coherence propagation and decay} (Ψ₂)
    \item \textbf{Emergent interference alignment} (Ψ₃)
    \item \textbf{Adaptive self-stabilization} (Ψ₄)
\end{enumerate}
Together, they define the \emph{algebraic coherence manifold}—a foundation for higher-level (Φ, Ω, Λ) Tessaris research.
