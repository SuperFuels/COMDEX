Section 2 — Algebraic Foundations of Symatics Algebra

⸻

2.1. Base Concept

Symatics Algebra is a mathematical framework designed to describe resonant, wave-based interactions between informational or energetic fields.
Where classical algebra manipulates quantities, and quantum algebra manipulates operators on states, Symatics Algebra manipulates waveforms of meaning — field entities that carry amplitude, phase, and harmonic identity.

Each entity is represented by a symbol Ψ (Psi), and every operation represents a harmonic transformation, rather than simple arithmetic.

2.2. Core Entities and Sets

Let’s define the primary sets:

Symbol                              Set                         Description
Ψ
𝕊 (Symatic Field Space)
The set of all field-states, i.e., vibrational entities carrying phase and amplitude across a manifold. Each Ψₙ ∈ 𝕊 represents one harmonic configuration of reality.
Φ
𝔉 (Field Operators)
Operators acting on field-states Ψ, transforming one configuration into another.
Ω
𝕆 (Observables)
The measurable aspects (frequency, phase, coherence) emerging from a field’s interactions.
Σ
𝕄 (Manifold)
The geometric substrate or domain in which Symatic fields evolve — spatial, energetic, or informational.
Λ
𝕃 (Logic Layer)
The meta-layer governing symbolic and semantic relationships between fields — used in CodexLogic and Photonic Algebra.


✅ At the end of Section 2

We now have:
	•	A complete algebraic language for describing Symatic transformations.
	•	Defined symbols, sets, and operator meanings.
	•	A bridge to logical semantics for Codex reasoning.
