3. Operator Taxonomy — Symatic, Photon, and Tensor Operators

This section defines the full symbolic grammar of the Tessaris algebraic framework — the operational language through which Symatic fields, photon manifolds, and Codex logic interact.
Each operator is defined by its symbol, formal algebraic definition, and semantic interpretation in the unified field model.

⊕
Resonant Superposition
Ψ₁ ⊕ Ψ₂ = R(Ψ₁, Ψ₂)
Combines two harmonic fields into a shared resonance envelope; constructive interference of Symatic waves.
∇
Gradient Operator
∇Ψ = (∂Ψ/∂x, ∂Ψ/∂y, ∂Ψ/∂z)
Extracts directional variation or energy flow through a Symatic field Ψ. Governs field topology.
↔
Bidirectional Coupling
Ψ₁ ↔ Ψ₂
Represents feedback resonance or mutual entanglement; energy flows symmetrically between states.
⊗
Tensor Binding
Φ₁ ⊗ Φ₂ = Ψ₃
Encodes photon–field interactions. The resulting Ψ₃ describes the coupled state of photonic and Symatic energy.
⊖
Phase Subtraction
Ψ₁ ⊖ Ψ₂ = Δφ
Describes destructive interference or phase cancellation between two resonant fields.
∴
Logical Inference
A ∴ B
Symbolic reasoning step: B follows logically or causally from A within Codex reasoning space.
¬
Negation / Inversion
¬Ψ = Ψ⁻¹
Represents field inversion, logical NOT, or harmonic inversion.
∨
Disjunction (Union)
Ψ₁ ∨ Ψ₂
Represents combined or coexisting states; union of field domains.
∧
Conjunction (Intersection)
Ψ₁ ∧ Ψ₂
Represents overlap or entangled coherence between two fields.
Δ
Field Mutation Operator
ΔΨ = Ψ’ − Ψ
Describes the temporal evolution or mutation of a Symatic field through an event boundary.
Ξ
Collapse Operator
Ξ(Ψ) = Ψ₀
Represents measurement or collapse of a probabilistic Symatic state into a discrete glyph state Ψ₀.
Ω
Resonant Frequency Constant
Ω = 2πf
Defines intrinsic angular frequency or base oscillatory identity of a photon-field system.
ℏ
Reduced Quantum Constant
ℏ = h / 2π
Scales discrete quanta of Codex energy across photon algebra. Used in Ψ–Φ quantization.
⨁
Codex Composition
A ⨁ B = Codex(A, B)
Composes logical or algebraic structures into higher-order Codex expressions.
∇⊗Ψ
Photon-Tensor Interaction
(∇⊗Ψ) = Tensor(∂Ψ/∂x, ∂Ψ/∂y, ∂Ψ/∂z, Φ)
Couples Symatic gradient flow with photon manifold Φ, describing energy diffusion and photon resonance.
Ψ ↦ Φ
Field-to-Photon Mapping
f: Ψ ↦ Φ
Transformation from Symatic wavefunction to photonic representation; defines Codex photon manifolds.
Φ ⇌ Ψ
Resonant Exchange
Φ ⇌ Ψ
Bidirectional photon–field exchange. Information and energy oscillate between domains.
⟐
Codex Harmonic Operator
⟐(Ψ, Φ) = CodexHarmonic(Ψ, Φ)
Encodes symbolic harmony between logical and energetic states — core of Symatic resonance.
⊚
Temporal Coherence
Ψ⊚t = Coherence(Ψ, t)
Describes persistence of resonance over time; maintains field stability within photon manifold.


🧠 Notes and Extensions
	•	Symatic Field (Ψ): Represents structured harmonic information, a field of symbolic resonance patterns.
	•	Photon Manifold (Φ): Represents quantized, light-like informational quanta interacting with Ψ through ⊗ and ∇.
	•	Codex Tensor (Ξₙ): The multidimensional structure binding Ψ and Φ within an informational geometry.
	•	Codex Resonance Equations: emerge from combinations like ∇⊗Ψ = Φ and Ψ ↔ Φ, forming the dynamic system of photon algebra.
