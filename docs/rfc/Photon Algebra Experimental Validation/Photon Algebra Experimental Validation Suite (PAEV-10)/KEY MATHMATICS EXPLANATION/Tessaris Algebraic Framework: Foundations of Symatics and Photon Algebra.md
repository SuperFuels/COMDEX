üìò The Tessaris Algebraic Framework: Foundations of Symatics and Photon Algebra

Abstract

Briefly describe the purpose of the framework ‚Äî to unify symbolic reasoning, energy-state modeling, and cognitive field operations through algebraic structures.
	‚Ä¢	Mention that this document defines the mathematical and semantic rules for Symatics Algebra, Photon Algebra, and related symbolic operations.
	‚Ä¢	Clarify that the system underpins the Tessaris reasoning engine (formerly COMDEX).

1. Introduction
	‚Ä¢	Context: Explain that Tessaris requires a formal symbolic grammar to reason about energy, cognition, and field dynamics.
	‚Ä¢	Motivation: These algebras allow symbolic-physical translation ‚Äî connecting logic operations with energy transformations.
	‚Ä¢	Scope: Outline that the paper covers algebraic definitions, operator semantics, and computational representations.

2. Foundational Domains and Objects

Define the basic entities (the universe of your mathematics):

Symbol / Term
Domain
Description
Œ®
Field Function
Represents a harmonic or cognitive field.
Œ¶
Photon Packet
Discrete energy unit; represents a light-encoded logic state.
G
Glyph
Symbolic node representing an operation, entity, or concept.
M
Manifold
Geometric substrate for field and glyph interaction.
œÅ
Resonance Density
Scalar field defining vibrational energy density.


Explain how these objects interact ‚Äî e.g., photons operate on fields, glyphs encode transformations, manifolds define embedding space.

3. Operator Taxonomy

Describe all key operators, their notation, and how they act.
Each operator should have (a) a symbolic definition, (b) a semantic meaning, and (c) example usage.

Symbol
Operator Name
Algebraic Definition
Interpretation
‚äï
Resonant Superposition
Œ®‚ÇÅ ‚äï Œ®‚ÇÇ = R(Œ®‚ÇÅ,Œ®‚ÇÇ)
Combines harmonic fields into resonance.
‚àá
Gradient Operator
‚àáŒ® = (‚àÇŒ®/‚àÇx, ‚àÇŒ®/‚àÇy, ‚àÇŒ®/‚àÇz)
Extracts directional energy variation.
‚Üî
Bidirectional Coupling
Œ®‚ÇÅ ‚Üî Œ®‚ÇÇ
Mutual resonance or entangled interaction.
‚äó
Tensor Binding
Œ¶‚ÇÅ ‚äó Œ¶‚ÇÇ = Œ®‚ÇÉ
Encodes photon-field interaction.
‚à¥
Logical Inference
A ‚à¥ B
Symbolic reasoning step connecting glyphs.


You can expand this to include:
	‚Ä¢	Logical operators (¬¨, ‚à®, ‚àß)
	‚Ä¢	Quantum or photonic ones (‚Ñè, Œ©)
	‚Ä¢	Field mutation or collapse operators (Œî, Œû, etc.)

4. Axioms and Algebraic Constraints

Define the laws that govern your system:
	‚Ä¢	Associativity / Non-associativity (‚äï may not be associative in nonlinear fields)
	‚Ä¢	Commutativity (‚äï may commute under certain symmetries)
	‚Ä¢	Conservation (e.g., photon energy conservation in ‚äó operations)
	‚Ä¢	Normalization / Entropy constraints

Example:

Axiom 1: Œ®‚ÇÅ ‚äï Œ®‚ÇÇ = Œ®‚ÇÇ ‚äï Œ®‚ÇÅ   (Resonance superposition is commutative)
Axiom 2: ‚àá(Œ®‚ÇÅ ‚äï Œ®‚ÇÇ) = ‚àáŒ®‚ÇÅ ‚äï ‚àáŒ®‚ÇÇ   (Gradient distributes across superposition)

5. Dimensional and Geometric Structure

Describe how the algebra exists in space/time or higher manifolds.
	‚Ä¢	Define dimensions (3D spatial, 1D temporal, optional cognitive dimension Œ∂)
	‚Ä¢	Show coordinate representations:

Œ®(x, y, z, t, Œ∂)

	‚Ä¢	Optionally introduce a resonance manifold metric
g_res = diag(1, 1, 1, -Œ±¬≤) controlling energy distortion.

6. Interpretive Examples

Write human-readable explanations for symbolic equations.

Example 1:

Œ®‚ÇÅ ‚äï Œ®‚ÇÇ = R(Œ®‚ÇÅ,Œ®‚ÇÇ)
When two harmonic fields overlap, their amplitudes interfere to form a resonance envelope R. This represents an emergent state in the Symatic manifold.

Example 2:

Œ¶ ‚äó Œ® = ‚àáŒ®'
Photon absorption induces a gradient in the target field, altering its local energy density.

7. Derived Relationships

Show multi-step derivations or combinations of operators:

Œ®‚ÇÅ ‚äï (Œ¶ ‚äó Œ®‚ÇÇ) ‚Üí ‚àáR

Explain the logic of how symbolic transformations propagate through the framework.

‚∏ª

8. Computational Representation

Describe how this algebra maps to Tessaris‚Äô data model:
	‚Ä¢	How operators correspond to glyph tokens (‚äï = logic.superpose)
	‚Ä¢	How field states are represented numerically (arrays, embeddings)
	‚Ä¢	How symbolic transformations are executed (runtime pipeline)

‚∏ª

9. Ontological Graph Encoding (optional)

Represent operator and entity relationships as a graph:
	‚Ä¢	Nodes: operators, glyphs, entities
	‚Ä¢	Edges: ‚Äúacts on,‚Äù ‚Äútransforms into,‚Äù ‚Äúentangles with‚Äù

This can later be serialized into the Codex Knowledge Graph or TessarisField.ghx files.

10. Example Simulation

Provide one short worked example showing real data flow, e.g.:

Œ®‚ÇÄ = initial harmonic field
Œ¶‚ÇÅ = photon input
Œ®‚ÇÅ = Œ¶‚ÇÅ ‚äó Œ®‚ÇÄ
Œ®‚ÇÇ = Œ®‚ÇÅ ‚äï Œ®‚ÇÄ
Result: R = resonance(Œ®‚ÇÇ)

11. Discussion & Future Work
	‚Ä¢	How this algebra unifies logical, energetic, and symbolic computation.
	‚Ä¢	Next steps: integrating symmetry groups, dynamic tensor fields, etc.

Would you like me to generate this into a formatted LaTeX or Markdown research paper file (so you can begin filling in your equations right away)?
I can make it auto-numbered and sectioned like a real math paper.
