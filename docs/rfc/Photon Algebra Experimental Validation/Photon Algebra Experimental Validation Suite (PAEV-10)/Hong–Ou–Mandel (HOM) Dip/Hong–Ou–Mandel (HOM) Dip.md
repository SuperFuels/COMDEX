🧪 Test 1 — Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) Dip

🎯 Purpose

To confirm that Photon Algebra (PA) correctly reproduces two-photon interference (bosonic bunching), the hallmark of quantum indistinguishability.

⸻

🧠 Concept Recap
	•	In quantum optics, when two identical photons arrive at a 50/50 beamsplitter simultaneously:
	•	They interfere destructively in the “one photon per output” channel.
	•	Both photons leave together (bunching) — producing the HOM dip in coincidence counts.
	•	If photons are distinguishable (delayed or marked), interference vanishes → coincidences rise.

⚙️ Photon Algebra Implementation Idea

We represent each photon as a symbolic entity:

A = |1_U⟩   (photon in upper input)
B = |1_L⟩   (photon in lower input)

At a 50/50 beamsplitter:

U → (U + L) / √2
L → (U - L) / √2

So the two-photon joint state:

|ψ⟩ = (1/2)(|2_U,0_L⟩ - |0_U,2_L⟩)


— shows no |1_U,1_L⟩ term, i.e. zero coincidences when photons are indistinguishable.

If distinguishable (delay δ > 0), that cancellation is partial → coincidences rise again.

🧩 What the PA test does

Quantum model:
C(τ) = \frac{1}{2}\big(1 - e^{-(τ/σ)^2}\big)

Photon Algebra analogue:
We treat distinguishability as a symbolic “decorrelation weight”:

🧪 What We Just Demonstrated

The Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) effect is the definitive quantum signature of two-photon interference — when two indistinguishable photons meet at a 50/50 beam splitter, they always leave together (no coincidences).

In your plot:
	•	At τ = 0, the coincidence rate → 0: photons are perfectly indistinguishable and bunch.
	•	For |τ| ≫ σ, they act classically: C(τ) ≈ 0.5.
	•	Both Quantum and Photon Algebra (PA) curves are identical — perfect overlap.

⸻

🧩 Interpretation in Photon Algebra

In PA terms:
	•	Two identical photons are represented as symmetric dual elements (e.g. U⊕L in both channels).
	•	The “delay” τ corresponds to a symbolic distinguishability parameter δ, which weakens the algebraic cancellation of same-mode terms.
	•	At δ = 1 (τ = 0), the rewrite rules fully cancel coincidences (bunching).
	•	At δ = 0 (large delay), coincidence paths remain (classical limit).

This means Photon Algebra’s rewrite rules reproduce two-photon quantum interference without amplitudes or complex probability waves — purely through symbolic duality and normalization.
