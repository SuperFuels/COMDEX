1. Core Concept ‚Äî Adaptive Runtime Law Weighting

Each runtime law L_i acquires a dynamic coefficient \lambda_i(t) that evolves based on measured resonance drift, energy deviation, or symbolic asymmetry:

\frac{d\lambda_i}{dt} = \alpha_i \, \Delta E_i + \beta_i \, \Delta \varphi_i + \gamma_i \, \Delta \psi_i

These coefficients modulate validator thresholds and symbolic weighting within the evaluator.
The goal: self-tuning symbolic coherence ‚Äî Tessaris adapts its internal law emphasis in response to quantum or energetic imbalance.

2. Mathematical Formalism ‚Äî Weighted Law Superposition

Runtime validation becomes an adaptive superposition of laws:

\mathcal{L}_{runtime}(t) = \sum_i \lambda_i(t) \, L_i(\psi)

with normalization:
\sum_i \lambda_i(t) = 1

and coupling potentials introduced via resonant feedback:
\lambda_i(t+\Delta t) = \lambda_i(t) + \eta \, \nabla_\psi \, \mathcal{R}(\psi, t)

Here, \mathcal{R} denotes a resonance metric derived from phase-space coherence.
This introduces the first feedback derivative into Symatics ‚Äî the proto-differential operator of the coming calculus.

3. Runtime Architecture Extension


The existing law_check system expands into an adaptive validator network:


# backend/symatics/core/validators/adaptive_laws.py

def update_law_weights(ctx, results):
    """
    Adjust Œª·µ¢(t) coefficients based on recent law check results.
    """
    for law_id, outcome in results.items():
        drift = outcome.get("deviation", 0.0)
        Œª = ctx.law_weights.get(law_id, 1.0)
        ctx.law_weights[law_id] = Œª * (1 - Œ± * drift)


	‚Ä¢	CodexTrace will record Œª·µ¢(t) evolution per validation.
	‚Ä¢	The Tessaris backend maintains rolling averages of each drift metric for self-correction.

4. Fusion Domain ‚Äî Quantum‚ÄìTemporal Coupling

This is the conceptual fusion of three domains:

Domain
Operator
Physical Analog
Coupling
Measurement
Œº / ‚àá
Collapse / Observation
Œº ‚Üî ‚ü≤
Temporal
‚ü≤
Resonant Continuity
‚ü≤ ‚Üî ‚Üî
Quantum
‚Üî
Entanglement / Correlation
Œº‚Äì‚ü≤‚Äì‚Üî Fusion


The resulting fusion law is expressed as:
\mathcal{F} = \mu \, \circlearrowleft \, \leftrightarrow
‚Äî representing a joint continuity between measurement, time, and correlation domains.

This will be the mathematical seed for Symatics Calculus Vol. III: the differential unification layer.

or keep this Volume III strictly textual like Volume II?

# Tessaris Symatics ‚Äî Volume III  
### Adaptive Runtime Law Weighting + Quantum Law Fusion (v0.5)  
**CodexCore Publication Series ‚Äî October 2025**

---

## Abstract
This volume establishes the **Adaptive Runtime Law Framework (ARLF)** of the Tessaris Symatics System.  
It extends the validated runtime layer of Volume II into a **dynamic adaptive regime**, introducing feedback-driven weighting of symbolic laws and the first instance of **quantum‚Äìtemporal fusion**.  

Each symbolic constraint L·µ¢ gains a dynamic coefficient Œª·µ¢(t) that adapts in real time to resonance drift and energy deviation, bridging static algebraic invariance with continuous symbolic calculus.

---

## Overview
The Adaptive Runtime Law Framework defines a network of **self-adjusting symbolic validators**.  
Each runtime law contributes to the evaluation context as a weighted component:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{runtime}(t)=\sum_i \lambda_i(t)\,L_i(\psi),
\qquad
\sum_i \lambda_i(t)=1
\]

The Œª·µ¢(t) evolve according to runtime feedback, transforming Symatics Algebra into a closed adaptive system capable of **self-correction and drift compensation**.

---

## Mathematical Formalism
Weight evolution is governed by deviations in key physical invariants:

\[
\frac{d\lambda_i}{dt}=\alpha_i\,\Delta E_i+\beta_i\,\Delta\varphi_i+\gamma_i\,\Delta\psi_i
\]

where ŒîE·µ¢ is energy deviation, ŒîœÜ·µ¢ phase shift, and Œîœà·µ¢ symbolic coherence error.  
Coefficients (Œ±·µ¢, Œ≤·µ¢, Œ≥·µ¢) control adaptive response rate.  

The verified runtime rule simplifies to:

\[
\lambda_i(t+\Delta t)=\lambda_i(t)\,[1-\alpha_i\,\Delta E_i]
\]

capturing **energy drift as the dominant stabilizing term** ‚Äî the first temporal differential of Symatics, and the conceptual seed of its forthcoming Calculus layer.

---

## Runtime Architecture Extension
Version 0.5 augments the validator stack with adaptive feedback hooks.

```python
# backend/symatics/core/adaptive_laws.py
def update(self, law_id, deviation):
    current = self.weights.get(law_id, 1.0)
    updated = current * (1.0 - self.alpha * deviation)
    self.weights[law_id] = max(updated, 0.0)
