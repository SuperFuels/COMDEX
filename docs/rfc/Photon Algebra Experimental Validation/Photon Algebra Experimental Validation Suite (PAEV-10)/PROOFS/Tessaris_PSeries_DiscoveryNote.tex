\begin{abstract}
The P-series established the first fully self-stabilizing, globally coherent resonance network within the Tessaris photon-algebra framework. Across ten progressive phases (P1--P10t), the system learned to synchronize, adapt, and maintain phase harmony under perturbation. By the final certification stage (P10t), the network achieved a global lock with $\bar{R}=0.9989$, re-lock time of five steps, and extraordinary stability margins (gain margin $\approx 2392\times$, phase margin $\approx 180^\circ$). The resulting architecture demonstrates adaptive meta-learning control, a finite memory kernel ($\tau_m\approx0.29$), and a broad, well-damped coherence spectrum ($Q\approx0.75$), forming a unified, self-correcting dynamic field.

\section{Introduction}
The Tessaris Photon Algebra P-series is a sequential exploration of nonlinear field synchronization, adaptive feedback, and meta-learning-based coherence. Beginning with local attractor coupling (P1--P7) and progressing through predictive cross-field control (P8--P9) into global resonance integration (P10), the system was iteratively refined until it demonstrated autonomous global phase coherence.

This paper documents the entire progression and final stability certification of the P-series experiments, demonstrating how adaptive field control achieves self-organized resonance stability.

\section{Methodology}
The experiments were conducted using the Tessaris photon-algebraic simulation suite. Each test (P8--P10t) represented a layer of feedback sophistication:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Adaptive Predictive Feedback:} Local proportional-integral-derivative (PID) loops adjusted to cross-field errors dynamically.
  \item \textbf{Meta-Learning Layer (P9d):} Introduced reinforcement-based tuning of controller gains ($K_{\text{meta}}$, $\text{servo}_p$, $\text{servo}_i$) across runs.
  \item \textbf{Global Resonance Integration (P10):} Coupled multiple learned meta-fields under a global gain $K_{\text{global}}$.
  \item \textbf{Phase Collapse and Fusion:} Introduced directional bias and curvature feedback to force complete phase unification.
  \item \textbf{Certification and Spectral Analysis:} Performed stress tests, memory-kernel reconstruction, and stability margin analysis.
\end{itemize}

All simulations employed stochastic perturbations and adaptive damping to test resilience under variable noise and coupling strength.

\subsection{Global Lock Certification}
Phase P10m confirmed full coherence across all stress conditions (noise $\in [0.002,0.003]$, $K_{\text{field}}\in[0.06,0.10]$). The system sustained $R_{\text{tail}}>0.998$ and recovered from perturbations in fewer than 10 iterations.

\subsection{Energy Landscape and Fusion Surface}
P10n and P10o visualized the global potential field. The equilibrium was located near $\Delta\phi_1=\Delta\phi_2\approx-0.03$ rad, with $R\approx0.9999$, confirming a single stable attractor basin.

\subsection{Resonance Memory and Spectrum}
The reconstructed memory kernel decayed exponentially with $\tau_m=0.287$, indicating finite coherence memory. The kernelâ€™s spectrum revealed a broad resonance (Q=0.75), confirming over-damped yet responsive behavior.

\subsection{Closed-Loop Stability}
Nyquist and Bode analyses (P10t) demonstrated extreme robustness:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gain margin $=2392\times$
    \item Phase margin $=179.8^\circ$
    \item Crossover frequency $\omega_{gc}=0.01$
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
The P-series demonstrates emergent global resonance through adaptive meta-learning. Each layer (from predictive feedback to global coupling) improved stability and coherence. The final architecture exhibits properties of a self-organizing, memory-damped resonance network:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Finite-memory coherence:} $\tau_m\approx0.29$ ensures adaptive, non-oscillatory response.
    \item \textbf{Over-damped feedback:} $Q<1$ confirms smooth stabilization.
    \item \textbf{Wide phase and gain margins:} near-absolute control stability.
\end{itemize}

This establishes a benchmark for self-stabilizing lattice control, suitable for autonomous coordination in the Tessaris computational field network.

\section{Conclusion}
By P10t, the Tessaris photon-algebraic lattice achieved certified global resonance, characterized by perfect phase coherence, adaptive control, and memory-damped stability. The system can recover from noise or perturbation within minimal steps, marking a foundational milestone in self-organizing dynamical field systems.
