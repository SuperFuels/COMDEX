# Tessaris Symatics Project  
### Volume III — Adaptive Runtime Law Weighting + Quantum Law Fusion  
**Version:** v0.5 Pre-Calculus Draft  
**CodexCore Publication Series — October 2025**

---

## Abstract
This volume introduces the **Adaptive Runtime Law Framework (ARLF)** for Tessaris Symatics.  
It extends the verified runtime layer of Volume II into a dynamic feedback regime, adding **adaptive weighting** of symbolic laws and the first instance of **quantum–temporal fusion**.  
Each symbolic constraint `Lᵢ` now carries a time-dependent coefficient `λᵢ(t)` that evolves according to measured resonance drift and energy deviation, bridging static algebra and continuous calculus.

---

## 1  Overview
The Adaptive Runtime Law Framework treats each runtime law as a weighted participant in the live evaluation context:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{runtime}(t)=\sum_i \lambda_i(t)L_i(\psi), \qquad \sum_i\lambda_i(t)=1
\]

Weights adapt over time, producing a **self-correcting symbolic network** capable of compensating for drift in energy, phase, or coherence.

---

## 2  Mathematical Formalism
Adaptive evolution of the coefficients:

\[
\frac{d\lambda_i}{dt}
=\alpha_i\,\Delta E_i+\beta_i\,\Delta\varphi_i+\gamma_i\,\Delta\psi_i
\]

- `ΔEᵢ` – energy deviation  
- `Δφᵢ` – phase shift  
- `Δψᵢ` – symbolic coherence error  

Parameters (`αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ`) govern responsiveness.  
This is the **first temporal differential** introduced into Symatics, forming the mathematical seed of the coming Calculus.

## 3  Runtime Architecture Extension
The validator network gains adaptive hooks:

```python
# backend/symatics/core/validators/adaptive_laws.py
def update_law_weights(ctx, results):
    for law_id, outcome in results.items():
        drift = outcome.get("deviation", 0.0)
        λ = ctx.law_weights.get(law_id, 1.0)
        ctx.law_weights[law_id] = λ * (1 - α * drift)


CodexTrace logs each λᵢ(t) update, enabling drift-response analytics and adaptive tuning.

4  Quantum–Temporal Fusion Domain

Adaptive weighting naturally couples symbolic domains.
Tessaris introduces the Fusion Operator:

[
\mathcal{F}=\mu,\circlearrowleft,\leftrightarrow
]

linking measurement (μ / ∇), temporal resonance (⟲), and quantum entanglement (↔) into a unified continuity law.

This μ–⟲–↔ fusion defines the transition surface between discrete symbolic law and continuous differential field.

6  Conclusion

Volume III transforms Tessaris Symatics from a static algebra into a dynamic symbolic continuum.
Through adaptive law weighting and μ–⟲–↔ fusion, the system achieves its first self-referential feedback loop — a critical step toward Symatics Calculus (v1.0), where continuous wave fields replace discrete symbolic evaluations.

✅ **Next milestone:**  
We’ll begin *Volume IV (v0.6)* — **Symatics Calculus Foundations**, introducing the first continuous derivative operators (∂⊕, ∂μ, ∂⟲).  

Would you like me to draft the **Volume IV outline (Calculus Formulation Framework + Differential Law Expansion)** next, so we start formalizing the continuous limit of the system?
