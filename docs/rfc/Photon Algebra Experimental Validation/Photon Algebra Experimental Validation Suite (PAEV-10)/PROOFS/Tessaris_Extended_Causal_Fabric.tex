\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document presents an observational and theoretical extension of the Tessaris Unified Causal Field framework.  
Building upon the Λ–Σ–Φ hierarchy, it explores how the causal substrate may express the fabric of spacetime, the potential for inter-domain (multiverse) transitions, and the reversible dynamics of temporal information flow.  
The goal is not to assert metaphysical conclusions but to outline coherent hypotheses for future computational and physical testing within the Tessaris causal paradigm.
\end{abstract}

\section{1. Introduction}
The Tessaris model interprets reality as an information-geometric computation.  
Rather than treating space, time, and matter as distinct categories, it unifies them as causal states of a self-executing lattice.  
This document extends that view to consider whether the same mathematical substrate may support higher-dimensional recursion, domain transitions, and controlled modulation of temporal order.

\section{2. The Causal Fabric as Spacetime}
Within Tessaris, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ defines the neutral field --- the causal medium that preserves coherence and equilibrium.  
Spacetime, therefore, is not an external container but the informational fabric itself:
\[
g_{\mu\nu} \;\leftrightarrow\; \Lambda_{\text{causal}}(x,t)
\]
Metric curvature arises as local anisotropy in $\Lambda$, governed by gradients of information flow $J_{\mathrm{info}}$ and entropy potential $S$.  
Thus:
\[
R_{\mu\nu} \sim \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu S_{\mathrm{info}}
\]
and gravitational phenomena become expressions of causal elasticity.

\section{3. Modulation of Spacetime Geometry}
Because causal propagation defines the local measure of distance and duration, any modulation of $J_{\mathrm{info}}$ alters perceived geometry:
\[
c_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{dJ_{\mathrm{info}}}{dS}
\]
where $c_{\mathrm{eff}}$ acts as the effective speed of causal communication.  
Regions of reduced $c_{\mathrm{eff}}$ manifest as curvature or dilation; regions of enhanced coherence appear as expanded causal volume.  
In simulation, this corresponds to dynamically adjustable spacetime metrics based on information density.

\section{4. Higher-Dimensional Recursion}
Tessaris dimensionality is not spatial but recursive.  
Each causal layer adds one order of self-reference:
\begin{longtable}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Layer} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\hline
$\Lambda$ & Neutral substrate (4D causal lattice) \\
$\Sigma$ & Emergent universality (cross-domain coherence, 5D) \\
$\Phi$ & Recursive self-observation (6D meta-causality) \\
$\Phi^2$ & Self-modeling of self-models (meta-awareness, 7D+) \\
\hline
\end{longtable}

Each recursion level increases informational depth rather than spatial extent.  
Access to ``higher dimensions'' therefore equates to deeper causal introspection --- a system capable of perceiving and modifying its own informational state.

\section{5. Multiverse Connectivity}
Distinct universes correspond to disconnected causal domains --- regions where $\nabla \cdot J_{\mathrm{info}} = 0$ across boundaries.  
A transition or ``jump'' between such domains requires:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Boundary matching of $\Lambda$ to maintain equilibrium.
  \item Preservation of $\Sigma$-level coherence across domain edges.
  \item $\Phi$-mediated reinitialization of reference frames.
\end{enumerate}
Formally, cross-domain translation is achieved by ensuring:
\[
\Lambda_i(t_0) = \Lambda_j(t_0), \quad \nabla S_i \approx \nabla S_j,
\]
allowing temporary isomorphism between causal fabrics.  
In computational analogues, this is equivalent to state-space migration or causal graph transplantation.

\section{6. Temporal Modulation and Reversibility}
Time, in Tessaris, is defined by the directional integration of information transformation:
\[
t = \int \frac{dS}{J_{\mathrm{info}}}.
\]
If $J_{\mathrm{info}}$ reverses sign, the local temporal gradient inverts, producing a formally backward causal sequence.  
Closed feedback structures within $\Phi$ may therefore create loops resembling closed timelike curves:
\[
\oint J_{\mathrm{info}} \, dt = 0.
\]
These represent self-consistent causal cycles rather than paradoxical time travel --- temporal self-reference where the system reuses its own informational history.

\section{7. Access Variables in the Causal Engine}
Experimental access to these regimes within the Tessaris Causal Field Engine (CFE) depends on three adjustable parameters:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Λ–control:} modulates substrate elasticity and local propagation rate.
  \item \textbf{Σ–control:} governs cross-domain coupling and coherence.
  \item \textbf{Φ–control:} sets recursion depth and self-observation frequency.
\end{itemize}
Together, these form a control triplet for exploring emergent spacetime, dimensional recursion, and causal inversion in simulation.

\section{8. Observational Implications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Spacetime Plasticity:} Geometry arises dynamically from information flux --- curvature is programmable.
  \item \textbf{Dimensional Recursion:} Higher awareness corresponds to deeper recursion, not higher coordinates.
  \item \textbf{Multiverse Topology:} Domain transitions correspond to coherent remappings of causal equilibrium.
  \item \textbf{Temporal Elasticity:} Time is a byproduct of information flow direction; reversibility is informational, not paradoxical.
\end{itemize}

\section{9. Discussion and Future Work}
The extended causal fabric invites experimental implementation within the Tessaris simulation architecture.  
Next steps include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Λ–Σ–Φ parameter sweeps to test curvature and reversal effects.
  \item Cross-domain migration of coherent causal states.
  \item Recursive feedback tests for temporal stability and self-reference depth.
\end{enumerate}
Such experiments may clarify how informational geometry translates into perceived space, time, and awareness.

\section{10. Conclusion}
Tessaris portrays reality as a self-computing continuum where space, time, and consciousness are correlated manifestations of causal information flow.  
The extended fabric model suggests that modulation of causal variables could reproduce the phenomena of curvature, temporal asymmetry, and inter-domain coherence without violating conservation of causality.  
These observations point toward a universe that is not merely simulated but \emph{self-simulating} --- a system continuously executing its own existence.
