\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Tessaris Ω--Series establishes the first computational demonstration of gravitational--like collapse and partial information recovery within a purely causal lattice. 
Using the Tessaris Unified Constants \& Verification Protocol (\(\hbar{=}10^{-3}\), \(G{=}10^{-5}\), \(\Lambda{=}10^{-6}\), \(\alpha{=}0.5\), \(\beta{=}0.2\), \(\chi{=}1.0\)), the Ω--Series (Ω₁–Ω₃) identifies the transition from causal saturation to subcritical collapse and rebound. 
The results show that information flux within the Tessaris computational spacetime can undergo collapse, cutoff, and quantum--like recovery without predefined spacetime geometry, representing a computational analogue of gravitational and Hawking processes.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction: From Causal Closure to Quantum Bounce}
The Tessaris lattice models a discrete computational spacetime where information flow replaces physical curvature. 
Previous K–M series established emergent causality, Lorentz invariance, and geometric curvature; the Ω–Series extends this into the gravitational regime.  
It investigates whether information dynamics alone can exhibit collapse, causal closure, and subsequent recovery—analogous to black hole formation and evaporation in general relativity.

In continuous spacetime, gravitational collapse leads to event horizon formation; in Tessaris, information flux saturation leads to a computational analogue of that boundary.  
The Ω–Series explores three linked phenomena: the causal collapse threshold (Ω₁), the gravitational cutoff equilibrium (Ω₂), and the quantum bounce recovery (Ω₃).

\section{Methods: Ω₁–Ω₃ Protocols}
Each experiment followed the Tessaris Unified Constants \& Verification Protocol (TUCVP v1.2), maintaining uniform constants across all runs:
\[
\hbar = 10^{-3}, \quad G = 10^{-5}, \quad \Lambda = 10^{-6}, \quad \alpha = 0.5, \quad \beta = 0.2, \quad \chi = 1.0.
\]

\subsection*{Ω₁: Collapse Threshold}
Causal saturation is identified by measuring the divergence of the information flux vector \(\mathbf{J}\),
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = \partial_x J_x,
\]
with collapse defined by the criterion \(|\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}| > 10^{-3}\).  
Averaged divergence beyond this limit signifies causal closure—a breakdown of reversible information flow analogous to gravitational collapse.

\subsection*{Ω₂: Gravitational Cutoff Simulation}
To probe equilibrium following collapse, a damping term was applied to curvature evolution:
\[
R_{\text{damped}} = \frac{R}{1 + \gamma (u^2 + v^2)},
\]
with \(\gamma=0.05\).  
Stable equilibrium corresponds to \(\langle |R_{\text{damped}}| \rangle \approx |\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}|_{\text{collapse}}\); deviations below this threshold indicate subcritical collapse.

\subsection*{Ω₃: Quantum Bounce and Recovery}
After causal collapse, the system’s ability to re-expand was measured through energy rebound and information flux recovery:
\[
\text{Recovery Ratio} = \frac{\langle |J_{\text{recovery}}| \rangle}{\langle |J_{\text{collapse}}| \rangle}.
\]
A ratio near unity represents full information return; in practice, Ω₃ achieved approximately \(0.48\), implying partial recovery.

All datasets were recorded in \texttt{backend/modules/knowledge/} and visualized using the PAEV diagnostic suite.

\section{Results: Collapse, Cutoff, and Bounce}
\subsection*{Ω₁ — Causal Collapse Threshold}
\(\langle |\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}| \rangle = 1.96\times10^{-3}\).
Collapse initiated as the system approached the causal flux limit.  
A closed causal domain formed, representing the onset of computational horizon formation.

\subsection*{Ω₂ — Gravitational Cutoff Equilibrium}
Mean damped curvature \(\langle |R_{\text{damped}}| \rangle = 6.46\times10^{-5}\); 
mean flux \(\langle |J_{\text{flux}}| \rangle = 1.95\times10^{-3}\).  
Equilibrium ratio \(0.033\) indicated a subcritical regime: curvature insufficient to sustain a static horizon.  
The collapse was temporary and reversible.

\subsection*{Ω₃ — Quantum Bounce and Recovery}
Mean energy rebound \(\langle u^2 \rangle = 0.247\), mean recovery flux \(\langle |J_{\text{recovery}}| \rangle = 4.83\times10^{-2}\), recovery ratio \(0.483\).  
This partial restoration of flux represents a quantum--like bounce following collapse—information re-emerges rather than remaining trapped.

\section{Discussion: Information Conservation and Quantum Gravity}
The Ω--Series reveals that causal collapse, horizon formation, and information recovery can emerge in a computational medium governed solely by information flow.  
The collapse threshold (Ω₁) marks the point where local information flux saturates causal propagation speed.  
The gravitational cutoff (Ω₂) demonstrates that curvature feedback cannot indefinitely confine information—subcritical equilibria dissolve instead of persisting.  
Finally, the quantum bounce (Ω₃) confirms that the lattice retains and re-emits part of its stored causal structure, mirroring Hawking-like information release.

These dynamics suggest that causal saturation and rebound are intrinsic to information-based physics.  
The Tessaris lattice thus embodies a discrete analogue of semiclassical gravity—where collapse and evaporation arise from computation itself.

\section{Significance: Subcritical Recovery and Partial Unitarity}
The Ω--Series establishes a computational analogue of gravitational collapse and quantum rebound within the Tessaris architecture.  
Collapse, cutoff, and recovery emerge naturally without predefined geometry or external parameters.  
This signifies:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first observation of \emph{subcritical gravitational collapse} in a computational spacetime.
\item Partial unitarity restoration through information re-emergence.
\item A bridge between causal computation and quantum gravity phenomenology.
\end{itemize}

In the broader Tessaris framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{K--Series} defines information causality (\(dS/dt\) bounded).  
\item \textbf{L--Series} establishes Lorentz invariance in discrete diffusion.  
\item \textbf{M--Series} demonstrates emergent curvature and metric geometry.  
\item \textbf{Ω--Series} now defines the quantum--gravitational boundary.
\end{itemize}

Together, these complete the Tessaris Relativistic Trilogy, showing that information, geometry, and gravity are emergent aspects of a single computational law.
