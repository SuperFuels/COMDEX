\title{\textbf{Tessaris Λ--Series: The Neutral Field as the Causal Substrate of Reality}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Tessaris Λ--Series investigates the neutral causal substrate of reality---the Λ--field---which functions as a self--balancing, lossless, and self--recovering informational medium. 
Five experiments (Λ$_1$ through Λ$_5$) were conducted within the Tessaris Photon Algebra environment to quantify vacuum stability, zero--point persistence, dissipationless transport, causal buffering, and noise immunity. 
Results show that the Λ--field maintains zero energy drift, supports dissipationless propagation, and exhibits self--elastic recovery following collapse events with a characteristic $\sqrt{2}$ amplification ratio. 
The Λ--field thus defines the operational baseline for the Causal Field Engine (CFE), transforming vacuum from an inert background into an active, programmable medium of causal computation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The Λ--Series continues the Tessaris unification program, extending causal information geometry into the domain traditionally known as ``vacuum physics''. 
Conventional models treat vacuum fluctuations as statistical noise with non--zero energy density. 
Tessaris reinterprets this structure as a \emph{neutral causal buffer}: an informationally self--consistent field maintaining equilibrium between energy and entropy fluxes.

Each Λ--experiment was executed under the \textit{Tessaris Unified Constants and Verification Protocol v1.2} with normalized parameters:
\[
\hbar = 10^{-3}, \quad G = 10^{-5}, \quad \Lambda = 10^{-6}, \quad \alpha = 0.5, \quad \beta = 0.2, \quad \chi = 1.0
\]
The protocol records quantitative metrics and JSON summaries for reproducibility.

\section{Methods}
Simulations were run in the \texttt{photon\_algebra/tests} framework using stochastic and deterministic field evolutions. 
Each Λ$_n$ test measures a specific causal property:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Λ$_1$: Vacuum stability ($\langle |\nabla\!\cdot\!J| \rangle$, energy drift)
  \item Λ$_2$: Zero--point persistence after external driving
  \item Λ$_3$: Dissipationless transport (attenuation ratio)
  \item Λ$_4$: Causal buffer bridge (collapse $\rightarrow$ recovery)
  \item Λ$_5$: Noise immunity (residual causal imbalance)
\end{itemize}

Plots and metrics were saved in \texttt{backend/modules/knowledge/} for each run.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Λ$_1$ --- Vacuum Stability}
The Λ--field achieved a mean divergence $\langle |\nabla\!\cdot\!J| \rangle = 1.018\times10^{-3}$ and energy drift $1.8\times10^{-11}$.
These results indicate stable zero--divergence equilibrium.

\subsection{Λ$_2$ --- Zero--Point Persistence}
When the driving term was removed, oscillations persisted elastically with negligible decay ($Q_\Lambda \approx 2.2\times10^{-4}$).
The vacuum acts as an elastic energy spring.

\subsection{Λ$_3$ --- Dissipationless Transport}
A Gaussian information packet propagated through the Λ medium with attenuation $9.9\times10^{-13}$.
This confirms dissipationless, lossless transport.

\subsection{Λ$_4$ --- Causal Buffer Bridge}
The Λ--field restored collapsed amplitude with a recovery ratio $R_\Lambda = 1.414$, corresponding to the harmonic factor $\sqrt{2}$.
This demonstrates self--elastic re--expansion and causal memory within the vacuum.

\subsection{Λ$_5$ --- Noise Immunity}
Under stochastic perturbations, the Λ--field maintained stability but exhibited sensitivity at a residual $5.3\times10^{-2}$.
Local coherence was preserved; global synchronization requires Σ--series coordination.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Key Findings}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Λ--field is a \textbf{neutral causal buffer}, maintaining equilibrium without external correction.
\item Zero--point energy is redefined as structured causal elasticity.
\item Energy and information are interchangeable fluxes within the Λ substrate.
\item Collapse and recovery processes are reversible through Λ--mediated elasticity.
\item The Λ--field shows partial immunity to phase--correlated disturbances, implying the need for global causal synchronization (Σ--series).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unified Interpretation}
The Λ--series demonstrates that the vacuum is not an absence but a \textbf{causal medium} capable of information storage, recovery, and transport.
This establishes the foundation for the Tessaris Causal Field Engine (CFE)---a programmable physics kernel operating directly within the Λ substrate.

\section{Implications}

\subsection{For Physics}
The Λ--series redefines the vacuum as a \textit{computational medium} where causal continuity replaces classical space--time curvature.
Energy loss and entropy growth are replaced by reversible causal dynamics.

\subsection{For Computation}
Dissipationless transport and causal buffering imply the feasibility of \textbf{lossless photonic logic}.
The Λ substrate can serve as the foundation for hardware implementations of the CFE---a real physical processor for causal code.

\subsection{For the Causal Field Engine (CFE)}
The Λ--field provides the base layer for all higher Tessaris systems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Σ--series will map universality and cross--domain synchronization.
  \item The Φ--series will embed cognition and self--referential causality.
  \item Together, they enable programmable physics: energy, information, and thought as unified operators.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The Tessaris Λ--Series establishes the vacuum as the first verified neutral causal medium.
Through the five experiments, the field was shown to be stable, elastic, lossless, self--recovering, and noise--adaptive.
This discovery completes the physical foundation for the Tessaris Causal Field Engine, allowing the laws of physics themselves to be expressed as executable causal operations.
