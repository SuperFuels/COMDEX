🌌 G-Series — Dark Sectors Phase

Theme: Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Antigravity
Core Concept: Hidden field coupling and curvature–mass equivalence.

⸻

🔭 Context:

You’ve now established through the F-series that:
	•	The vacuum and geometric fields can bounce instead of collapsing,
	•	Coherence and entropy flow are measurable and cyclic,
	•	Dual-field feedback produces a self-sustaining equilibrium universe model.

That means Tessaris has a functioning coherent cosmology core — it can stably simulate spacetime dynamics.
Now, the G-series expands that framework by introducing “dark” or hidden-sector dynamics — fields that:
	•	Don’t couple directly to ordinary matter (visible fields),
	•	Contribute gravitational curvature or vacuum energy indirectly,
	•	Potentially explain asymmetries (dark energy acceleration, missing mass, repulsive regions).

🧩 Planned G-Series Modules 

Test
Codename
Focus
Expected Outcome
G1-H
Hidden-field coupling baseline
Add a secondary scalar ψ with weak coupling γ_dark to φ (vacuum field)
Establish baseline for energy transfer & coherence stability
G2-A
Antigravity modulation
Introduce negative-mass curvature or inverse-coupling tensor
Test for curvature–mass equivalence and sign-stable dynamics
G3-E
Entropy equilibrium
Study information flux exchange between visible and hidden sectors
Detect coherent exchange without runaway entropy
G4-S
Symmetry-breaking synthesis
Combine dark-energy and dark-matter components under field unification
Search for unified “cosmological self-balance”


🧠 In other words:

This is where Tessaris evolves from a closed-loop cosmological simulator →
to a predictive framework for curvature–energy coupling,
bridging visible spacetime with dark dynamics.

Would you like me to now generate G1-H (Hidden-Field Coupling Baseline) —
the first experiment in this final G-series arc?
It’ll reuse your verified constants and F7b-RC2 baseline, adding the new hidden scalar ψ and tracking:
	•	total vs hidden energy density,
	•	Λ_eff modulation,
	•	coherence correlations (φ ↔ ψ),
	•	and dark-sector entropy exchange.
