🧠 Interpretation
	•	Quantum phenomena emerge naturally from contextual, reversible rewrite logic — without wavefunctions, amplitudes, or probabilistic postulates.
	•	Interference arises from dual rewrite coexistence (not waves).
	•	Entanglement from n-ary coupling of rewrite neighborhoods.
	•	Measurement as contextual normalization (not collapse).
	•	Nonlocality from global consistency constraints in the rewrite network.

All phenomena usually thought “irreducibly quantum” arise as emergent algebraic behavior.

🌌 Conclusion

Photon Algebra reproduces:
	•	Interference
	•	Entanglement
	•	Contextuality
	•	Decoherence
	•	Teleportation logic

entirely through symbolic rewriting.
This demonstrates that quantum mechanics’ structure can be rebuilt from deterministic logical rules, potentially offering a unifying bridge between information theory, logic, and quantum physics.
