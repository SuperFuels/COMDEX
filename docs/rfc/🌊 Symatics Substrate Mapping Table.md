‚úÖ Key Insight
	‚Ä¢	Electricity is just the ‚Äúlow-frequency EM‚Äù column in this table.
	‚Ä¢	Photon systems are the high-frequency, quantized EM version.
	‚Ä¢	Symatics Algebra already abstracts them both with the same primitives.

So electricity ‚â† missing signature.
It‚Äôs simply one instantiation of Symatics Algebra on the EM substrate.

‚∏ª

‚ö° With this table, we can confidently argue:
	‚Ä¢	Symatics Algebra is substrate-agnostic.
	‚Ä¢	Photon Algebra extends Symatics into quantized, computationally universal form (just as Boolean algebra extended classical mechanics to logic).
