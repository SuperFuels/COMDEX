## Photon Algebra (Auto-Generated)
### cancel

P5: Cancellation — ⊖
### collapse

P7: Collapse — ∇ selects a state based on SQI weights.
### entangle

P3: Entanglement — symmetric ↔
### fuse

P4: Resonance / Amplification — ⊗
### identity

P1: Identity — a ⊕ ∅ = a
### negate

P6: Negation — ¬
### project

P8: Projection — ★ returns SQI drift score.
### rewrite

Normalize expressions (flatten ⊕, eliminate neutral ops).
    Phase 1: very simple rules; expand later.
### superpose

P2: Superposition — combine states into ⊕
### to_boolean

Boolean ⊂ Photon — map state → {0,1} by SQI threshold.
