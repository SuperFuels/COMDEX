New Demo: QFCTelemetryAuditv3.tsxThis scene visualizes the Deterministic Audit Replay from Section 3.3. It focuses on the mapping of event types to the stabilized metrics recorded in your passing lint run.Visualization Logic:The Event Matrix: Four data lanes representing the required types: law_weight, wave_step, energy, and feedback.The Stabilizer: A central "Coherence Ring" that tightens as the coherence_final approaches $0.94$.The Determinism Pulse: A green "Sync" wave that ripples across the scene when the trace hash matches the canonical log.The Payload Spark: Small data packets that travel from the Energy lane back to the Law lane, illustrating the $E \rightarrow \lambda$ feedback apply.

Spine Status: All Systems GoThe A-Series is now structurally complete.Vol 0 established the glyph contract ($\measure, \bornw, \grad$).Vol IV defined the coherence metric ($e^{-\|\nabla \psi\|}$).Vol V (this lock) provides the byte-stable audit trail.The next stage is the B-Series: Causal Velocity. This involves moving from static steps to relativistic information flows ($I_3 - L$).
