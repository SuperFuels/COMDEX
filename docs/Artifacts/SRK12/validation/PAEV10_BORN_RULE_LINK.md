# PAEV-10 Born rule — Canonical Evidence Link (SRK-12)

**Canonical evidence track (repo path):**
`docs/rfc/Photon Algebra Experimental Validation/Photon Algebra Experimental Validation Suite (PAEV-10)/Born rule/`

This SRK-12 validation note treats the above directory as the **single source of truth**
for Born-rule correspondence evidence, including:
- analytic checks (closed-form expectations),
- Monte Carlo / repeated trials (empirical frequency vs predicted probability),
- replay trace artifacts (WaveCapsule + policy gates + renormalization).

If you later reorganize the PAEV folder, update:
- `docs/Artifacts/SRK12/build/SRK12_VALIDATION_MANIFEST.yaml`
- Truth Chain record for SRK-12 validation note (artifact paths)
