Final Demo Concept: QFCEmergentGeometryM.tsxThis scene will be the "Command Center" for the v0.4 trust chain, visualizing the field-derived geometry.1. The Dual-Well Exchange (M4b)Visual: Two glowing, fixed regions on the lattice (Well A and Well B).Dynamic: A "bridge" of flowing light between them, pulsing at the beat frequency ($2.083 \times 10^{-2}$).Metric: Real-time spark-lines showing the energy transfer amplitude ($2.392 \times 10^{-3}$).2. The Geodesic Centroid (M3d)Visual: A high-contrast white "marker" (the centroid) that moves along the field's center of mass.Motion: Oscillating within the $5.852 \times 10^{-1}$ amplitude range.3. Spectral Redshift Monitor (M5/M6)Visual: A small, high-fidelity FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) window in the UI corner.Logic: It tracks the "dominant frequency" of the field. Even though the shift is tiny ($-5.889 \times 10^{-6}$), the UI will provide a "Zoomed Phase-Shift" view to show the emergence of the redshift analogue.4. The Metric Overlay (M1)Visual: A persistent HUD (Heads-Up Display) showing:$g_{tt} \approx -1.122$$g_{xx} \approx 1.027$$R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ Surface: A wireframe plane that dips and curves locally based on the field intensity.Final Verification StepModuleVisual ElementPinned ValueStatusM1Metric HUD$g_{tt} -1.122$LOCKEDM3dCentroid MarkerAmp: $0.5852$LOCKEDM4bWell ExchangeFreq: $0.0208$LOCKEDM5Redshift Panel$\Delta\omega/\omega$LOCKED
