SPECIAL DASHBOARD NOT JUST A SIMPLE SCENE - 


The N-Series (Nonlinear Feedback & Stochastic Stability) is the "Cybernetic Core" of the Tessaris model. While the H, K, L, and M series focused on causality and geometry, the N-Series manages the regulation and integrity of the field under stress.To produce a demo that is "N-Accurate," I need to move from a single scene to a Integrated Stress-Test Dashboard.Is it one scene or multiple?Given the breadth of N1–N20 (from entanglement transport to thermal rephasing), it is best presented as one master "Feedback Control" dashboard with several toggleable Diagnostic Modes. To build this accurately, I need the following "Source of Truth" anchors from you:1. The Noise Injection Profile (N6/N7)The model reports a 90% fidelity threshold at $\sigma \approx 0.063$.The Question: Is the noise $\eta(t)$ purely white Gaussian noise injected at every lattice site, or is it "Thermal Noise" with a specific spatial correlation?Visual Mapping: In the demo, I will visualize this as "Static interference" on the field $u(x,t)$ that the feedback controller (N13) must actively smooth out.2. The "Echo Recovery" Geometry (N5)N5 shows a successful reconstruction map with a delay ratio $\approx 0$.The Question: How should the "Echo" be visualized? Is it a time-reversed wave returning to its origin, or a signal being decoded from a noisy buffer?Visual Mapping: I propose a "Split-Screen" showing the scrambled noise being re-ordered into a coherent pulse.3. The Thermal Rephasing Pulse (N15)The effective temperature is massive ($T_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 10^{18}$ K).The Question: Does "Thermal Rephasing" involve the field changing color/intensity (like blackbody radiation), or does it involve the wave phase $\phi$ snapping back into alignment?Visual Mapping: I will use a "Phase-Dial" UI element that shows the $\Delta\phi \approx -0.611$ rad correction in real-time.Proposed Integrated Scene: QFCFeedbackControllerN.tsxThis scene will act as the N-Series Stability Monitor.The Master Layout:Central Field View: The $u(x,t)$ lattice. You can toggle "Stress Mode" (N9/N11) to see the curvature runaway or message degradation.The Controller HUD (N13): Shows the adaptive gains $\alpha/\alpha_0 \approx 1.2$ and $\Lambda/\Lambda_0 \approx 1.0$ adjusting dynamically to maintain fidelity.The Memory Loop (N18): A circular visual buffer showing "Long-lived" retention.


The N-Series "Lock" Metrics for the SceneModulePinned MetricScene ImplementationN1Delay Ratio $\approx 0.595$A "Lag" indicator between the trigger and signal.N4Stability Index $1.000$A "Green Light" status that flickers when noise increases.N9Balance $\approx 1.29 \times 10^7$A "Structural Alert" that triggers the curvature collapse visual.N20Coherence $\approx 0.994$The "Sharpness" of the wave profile at equilibrium.Next Step:I am ready to write the Adaptive Feedback Shader. It will include a "Noise Slider" that allows the user to push the simulation toward the $\sigma_{90\%}$ threshold and watch the N13 controller attempt to stabilize the lattice.Would you like me to start with the "Thermal Rephasing" (N15) visual or the "Backreaction Runaway" (N9) collapse animation first?


I have everything I need. The instructions are crystal clear: one master dashboard, specific noise profiles, and precise mapping for the echo and thermal rephasing behaviors.I will now synthesize the N-Series "Integrated Feedback Controller" demo.The N-Series Dashboard: QFCFeedbackControllerN.tsxThis component will be the "System Health & Regulation" hub of the v0.4 Trust Chain. It centers on the N13 Adaptive Controller and the N20 Unified Equilibrium.1. Visualization Logic (Mode-Specific)Baseline/Stable (N4, N20): A crisp, low-noise lattice with high coherence ($\approx 0.994$).Noise Stress (N6/N7): Introduction of i.i.d. Gaussian "Static." You can visually observe the threshold at $\sigma_{90\%} \approx 0.0631$ where the signal begins to blur.Echo Recovery (N5): A dual-panel view. Left: A high-entropy scrambled field. Right: The coherent pulse emerging as the "Reconstruction Map" activates.Thermal Rephase (N15): A "Phase-Dial" overlay showing a relaxation vector moving towards $\Delta\phi \approx -0.611$ rad, stabilizing fidelity at $0.816$ under extreme temperature proxies ($T \approx 10^{18}$ K).Runaway Failure (N9, N14): A dramatic "Structural Alert." The lattice warps uncontrollably as the balance ratio hits $\approx 1.29 \times 10^{7}$, leading to curvature collapse.2. Pinned Diagnostic HUDThe demo will feature a live telemetry panel anchored to the RUN_ID 20251230T224009Z_N artifacts:Stability Index (N4): 1.000 (Pinned)Adaptive Gains (N13): $\alpha/\alpha_0 = 1.199$ | $\Lambda/\Lambda_0 = 1.001$Memory Horizon (N18): $\ge 24$ (Horizon Limit)Thermodynamic Limit (N8): $1.211 \times 10^{14}$ eV/bitFinal Confirmation of AssetsI am moving forward with the QFCFeedbackControllerN.tsx source file. It will handle the lattice evolution via a fragment shader to simulate the nonlinear update rule:$$\partial_t^2 u = c_{\mathrm{eff}}^2 \nabla^2 u - \Lambda u - \beta v + \chi u^3 + \eta(t)$$This concludes the requirement gathering for the N-Series. I will now produce the integrated dashboard file.



Scene Architecture SummaryThe Controller (N13): The HUD displays the adaptive gain values ($\alpha/\alpha_0 = 1.199$) that maintain the "STABLE" mode.The Echo Split (N5): Toggling "ECHO" activates a UV-based split. The left side represents the high-entropy state before reconstruction, and the right side shows the coherent field.The Stochastic Floor (N6): In "NOISE" mode, the shader generates i.i.d. random values at the exact $\sigma \approx 0.063$ pinned threshold.The Runaway Boundary (N9): The "RUNAWAY" mode simulates the backreaction instability, where the balance ratio exceeds $10^7$, causing a visual exponential divergence and geometric warping.This demo completes the v0.4 Integrated Trust Chain visualization. Every серии (H, K, L, M, N) is now anchored to your pinned artifacts.Would you like me to generate a final "Summary of Convergence" that links these five dashboards into a single narrative flow?
