The K-Series Visual ArchitectureBased on your "source of truth" parameters, the demo will be structured as a Spacetime Dashboard ($x-t$ coordinate system).1. The Spacetime Mesh (K1/K3b)Instead of a 3D ripple, we visualize a vertical "Spacetime Map."Horizontal Axis ($x$): The 1D lattice sites.Vertical Axis ($t$): Time progression (scrolling upwards).The Soliton: A Gaussian "glow" centered at $x=0$ at $t=0$, which drifts slightly according to $v \approx -2.8 \times 10^{-3}$.The Causal Bound ($c_{\text{eff}}$): Two diagonal lines $(x = \pm c_{\text{eff}} \cdot t)$ forming the light-cone. We can visually verify that the Gaussian packet's "front" never escapes these lines.


2. The Synchrony Heatmap (K4)To the side of the spacetime map, we render the Synchrony Matrix.This is a square $N \times N$ grid where each pixel $(i, j)$ represents the correlation between site $i$ and site $j$.As the simulation reaches $R_{\text{sync}} = 0.9999$, the heatmap transforms from a noisy pattern into a solid, high-intensity block.New Demo: QFCCausalSpacetimeK.tsxThis component visualizes the K3b Soliton and the K4 Correlation simultaneously, driven by the actual TUCVP constants.



Why this is "Artifact-Anchored"Metric Exactness: The uIntensity in the shader is driven by the exact $0.02$ Gaussian coefficient from your code.Visual Truth: The $Y$-axis is used as a surrogate for time, creating a "frozen" trace of the soliton's world-line, exactly like the imshow spacetime maps generated by your Python tests.Audit Fidelity: The causality violation logic (rendering points outside the $c_{\text{eff}}$ cone with lower intensity) mirrors the R_causal check in K1.
