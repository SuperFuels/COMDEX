New Demo: QFCGeometryEmergence.tsxThis scene visualizes the core claim of Section 5: Geometry as a Projection of Phase Order. It demonstrates the transition from a "Raw Phase Stream" (unstructured) to a "Geometric Ring" (structured) once the closure condition $e^{i\,2\pi_s n}=1$ is met.Visualization Logic:Phase Noise (Left): A chaotic cloud of particles representing raw $\phi_k$ updates before closure.The Closure Gate: A vertical "Truth Plane" at the center. As particles pass through, they are filtered by the winding number logic ($n=1$).Emergent Form (Right): On the other side of the gate, the particles snap into a perfect golden ring—the "derived geometry."$\pi$ Manifest: The digits of $\pi$ scroll across the ring's surface, indicating that the metric ratio is now a locked property of the stable phase dynamics.


Strategic Direction: The Causal GapWith Volume VII establishing the geometric ring and Volume V establishing the telemetry for law weights ($\lambda$), we have a tension:Volume VII gives us Spatial Form ($\pi$).Volume V gives us Temporal Feedback ($t \rightarrow t+\Delta t$).What is missing is the Causal Velocity—the limit at which information propagates across the ring indices. This is the I3-L "information causality" layer we parked earlier.
