\begin{abstract}
This note provides (i) a structured comparison between Symatics and nearby mathematical formalisms used in quantum theory and
quantum logic, and (ii) two separation theorems supported by deterministic, audit-grade counterexample artifacts and Lean proofs.
The emphasis is not on reclassifying standard *-algebraic objects (handled elsewhere), but on demonstrating that the \emph{phase-indexed}
interference primitive in Symatics is not reducible to common \(\varphi\)-free abstractions (effect algebras/orthomodular lattices) nor to a
plain semiring of amplitudes, except at boundary phases \(\varphi \in \{0,\pi\}\). The semiring separation is locked in the strong,
distributivity-obstruction form with an explicit \(\mathrm{LHS}\neq\mathrm{RHS}\) witness.
\end{abstract}

\section{What is being compared}

Symatics defines an operator calculus over complex-valued amplitude-like objects together with an explicit \emph{phase parameter}
\(\varphi\) controlling interference. The key feature relevant to this document is that there exist fixed inputs such that
the \(\varphi\)-indexed interference output (denoted \(\mathrm{Interf}_{\varphi}(\cdot,\cdot)\)) is measurably different as \(\varphi\) varies,
and this difference is intended and semantically meaningful.

Throughout, ``representation'' means a map \(h\) into a candidate structure that preserves a designated operation (exactly, or up to a
numerical tolerance) \emph{without access to \(\varphi\)} (for N1), or a candidate algebraic law (for N2).

\section{Novelty theorems}

\subsection{N1: Effect-algebra / OML representation failure (phase irreducibility)}

\begin{definition}[\(\varphi\)-free candidate representation]
A candidate ``effect-algebra/OML-style representation'' for \(\mathrm{Interf}_{\varphi}(A,B)\) is any map \(h\) into a target
structure with a commutative, \(\varphi\)-free combination operation \(\boxplus\) (e.g., partial sum \(\oplus\) or join-like operation),
together with a rule of the form
\[
h(\mathrm{Interf}_{\varphi}(A,B)) \;=\; F(h(A),h(B)),
\]
where \(F\) is built from \(\varphi\)-free target operations only (no dependence on \(\varphi\)).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Phase irreducibility into \(\varphi\)-free effect-algebra/OML candidates]
\label{thm:effectalg}
Fix \(\varphi_1=\pi/3\) and \(\varphi_2=\pi/2\). There exist explicit inputs \(A,B\) such that:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item \(\mathrm{Interf}_{\varphi_1}(A,B) \neq \mathrm{Interf}_{\varphi_2}(A,B)\) in Symatics, with measured separation
\(\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{sym}}(\varphi_1,\varphi_2) > 10^{-6}\);
\item for the locked \(\varphi\)-free candidate rule \(h(\mathrm{Interf}_{\varphi}(A,B)) := h(A) \boxplus h(B)\),
the candidate is forced \(\varphi\)-invariant, yielding \(\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{cand}}=0 < 10^{-12}\);
\item therefore no operation-preserving, \(\varphi\)-free effect-algebra/OML representation can track phase-indexed interference for all \(\varphi\),
except at boundary phases where interference degenerates (\(\varphi \in \{0,\pi\}\)).
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Locked witness (audit-grade).}
Deterministic runner (seeded, canonical phases): \texttt{SEED=0 python backend/tests/run\_sym\_effectalg\_separation\_lint.py}.
Artifacts:
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/EFFECTALG_COUNTEREXAMPLE.json} (sha256 \texttt{90472750420f76dc3349626fa984cbeb364d2f75b3c3c2a84659cfb8af170cce})
\item \url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/EFFECTALG_METRICS.json}
\item \url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/EFFECTALG_LINT_PROOF.log}
\end{itemize}
The locked numeric witness records:
\[
\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{sym}}(\varphi_1,\varphi_2) = 0.1522419296557033,\qquad
\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{cand}} = 0,
\]
against thresholds \(\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{sym}} > 10^{-6}\) and \(\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{cand}} < 10^{-12}\) (PASS).

\subsection{N2: Non-semiring (strong distributivity obstruction) for \(\varphi \neq 0,\pi\)}

\begin{definition}[Semiring-like candidate operations used in the lock]
In the \texttt{sym\_compare\_v1} semiring separation lock, the candidate operations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``addition'': \(X \oplus Y := \mathrm{canon}(\mathrm{Interf}_{\varphi}(X,Y))\) with fixed \(\varphi=\pi/3\),
      where \(\mathrm{Interf}_{\varphi}(X,Y)=X+e^{i\varphi}Y\) and \(\mathrm{canon}\) is L2-normalization \(v\mapsto v/\lVert v\rVert\) with a \(0\)-guard;
\item ``multiplication'': \(X \odot Y := \mathrm{Hadamard}(X,Y)\), i.e.\ componentwise complex multiplication.
\end{itemize}
These choices model ``superposition-like'' combination (\(\oplus\)) and ``independent per-coordinate composition'' (\(\odot\)).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[No semiring distributivity for the locked candidate at non-boundary phase]
\label{thm:semiring}
Fix \(\varphi=\pi/3\). For the candidate operations \((\oplus,\odot)\) defined above, there exist explicit inputs \(A,B,C\) such that
strict distributivity fails:
\[
(A \oplus B)\odot C \;\neq\; (A\odot C)\oplus (B\odot C).
\]
Equivalently, the distributivity law required of a semiring cannot hold for these natural identifications of ``addition'' and ``multiplication''
with Symatics interference and per-coordinate composition at \(\varphi\neq 0,\pi\). Therefore Symatics is not representable as a plain semiring
amplitude calculus at non-boundary phases without discarding phase-governed structure (i.e., collapsing it).
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Locked witness (audit-grade).}
Deterministic runner: \texttt{SEED=0 python backend/tests/run\_sym\_semiring\_separation\_lint.py}. This runner locks a concrete
distributivity witness (LHS/RHS vectors and their separation). Artifacts:
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/SEMIRING_COUNTEREXAMPLE.json} (sha256 \texttt{14f3186a5ce5cc6532cd72b323fcc5ee42c49b4da5a0829b7c32e9de75bdbd4c})
\item \url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/SEMIRING_METRICS.json}
\item \url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/SEMIRING_LINT_PROOF.log}
\end{itemize}
The locked witness (from \texttt{SEMIRING\_COUNTEREXAMPLE.json}) records:
\[
\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{distrib}} = 0.8995171233023482,
\]
and the centralized acceptance threshold requires \(\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{distrib}} > 10^{-6}\) (PASS), with threshold name
\texttt{semiring.distrib\_distance\_min} in
\url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/SYM_COMPARE_ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.yaml}.

\section{Evidence links (locked artifact roots)}

All evidence in this document is tied to deterministic runners and emitted artifacts. Canonical root:
\url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/}, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/SYM_COMPARE_ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLDS.yaml}
\item \url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/SYM_COMPARE_LOCK_SURFACE.json}
\item \url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/EFFECTALG_COUNTEREXAMPLE.json},

\url{docs/Artifacts/sym_compare_v1/SEMIRING_LINT_PROOF.log}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Formal verification (Lean).}
The no-go statements for N1 and N2 are proved as \emph{abstract} theorems in Lean, while the \emph{concrete}
numerical witnesses are supplied by the locked JSON artifacts above. Lean proof file:
\url{backend/modules/lean/workspace/SymaticsBridge/SymCompare/NoGo.lean}. Witness/lock binding module:
\url{backend/modules/lean/workspace/SymaticsBridge/SymCompare/Witnesses.lean}. Verification command:
\[
\texttt{cd backend/modules/lean/workspace \;\&\&\; lake build SymaticsBridge.SymCompare.NoGo SymaticsBridge.SymCompare.Witnesses}.
\]

\section{Scope statement (what is and is not claimed)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Photon Algebra v0.3 provides standard *-algebra classification checks (closure, associativity, *-law, etc.). This is not claimed
as novel mathematics.
\item The novelty claim is the \emph{operator calculus} built around explicitly parameterized interference and governed collapse, plus the
\emph{separation theorems} showing Symatics is not reducible to nearby candidate abstractions (effect-algebra/OML, semiring),
while remaining QM-consistent where intended (Born-rule / projector tests).
\item Auditability is treated as a first-class requirement: deterministic seeds, canonical parameter choices, and SHA-256 digests are
considered part of the mathematical object being presented.
\end{itemize}
