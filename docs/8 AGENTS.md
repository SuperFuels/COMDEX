âœ… So what file (or part of AION) should create agents?

1. Near-term: create_agent.py
	â€¢	This utility script can be your main agent spawner.
	â€¢	Weâ€™ll inject a DNA Switch and register the agent when created.
	â€¢	Can be called by hand or programmatically.

2. Mid-term: AgentManager
	â€¢	This is the central controller that registers and runs all agents.
	â€¢	It should eventually be able to dynamically import/generate agents at runtime.
	â€¢	Needs a method like spawn_agent(name, type='sample', config=None).

3. Future: GoalEngine or DreamCore
	â€¢	AION could generate an agent inside a dream or strategy.
	â€¢	E.g. "Create a scout agent to explore a .dc training maze"
	â€¢	This becomes a self-replicating loop based on dream â†’ milestone â†’ action. 

      â€¢   Add support later for different agent types (ExplorerAgent, MentorAgent, etc.).
    â€¢   Inject .dc awareness per agent during runtime by passing in space context.
    â€¢   Log each agentâ€™s DNA path or environment trail to memory.

Let me know if you want to:
    â€¢   Auto-spawn agents via CLI or scheduler
    â€¢   Visualize current agents + their memory trails
    â€¢   Simulate .dc transitions between containers per agent




    we need to add this to terminal - presets in drop down to create new agents, what type, to do what etc
    python backend/scripts/create_agent.py nova 

This will:  "createing new agents"
    â€¢   Create a new SampleAgent with the name "nova"
    â€¢   Register it with the AgentManager
    â€¢   Auto-inject a DNA Switch trail


Would you like me to also: for "createing new agents"
    â€¢   Add optional .dc container context on creation?
    â€¢   Log new agent creation to AION memory?
    â€¢   Allow specifying agent type (SampleAgent, ExplorerAgent, etc.)?


Let me know if you want to:
    â€¢   Auto-scan the modules/aion/ and hexcore/ folders to batch-inject
    â€¢   Add auto-DNA registration to newly created .dc files too



Let me know if you want this spawning logic linked to a goal or strategy module so AION can autonomously create agents mid-cycle.



    But ideally, agents should eventually be:
    â€¢   ðŸ§  Autonomously generated by AIONâ€™s internal decision engine, dream reflections, or triggered goals
    â€¢   ðŸª¬ Templated or cloned from an agent factory or blueprint
