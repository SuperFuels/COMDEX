Document 1: How Everything Works - STICKEY Platform
STICKEY is designed to simplify and streamline global commodity trade, leveraging blockchain technology, AI, and a decentralized approach to create an efficient and transparent marketplace. Here's how it works:

1. Landing Page:
User Interaction:

New users can either sign up or log in via wallet-based authentication (using MetaMask).

The wallet automatically logs users in if previously registered, making the platform easy to use.

Once logged in, users can view their wallet balance in $GLU.

Product Search:

A simple search bar for commodities. Initially, it will feature basic options like Whey Protein and Cocoa. In the future, AI will enable advanced searches (e.g., "Find a supplier in South Africa for 1 tonne of organic coffee beans").

Real-time price and exchange rates for commodities will be displayed in a scrolling bar.

Currency Swap:

Swap currency option will be visible on the homepage but will expand when clicked to facilitate easy conversion of GBP, USD, and other major currencies into $GLU.

2. Product Search Page:
Product Listings:

Displays key information about each product like supplier name, origin, price per kg in $GLU and USD, and certifications.

Basic filters like price, rating, and supplier type.

Product Details:

Clicking on a product brings the user to a dedicated product page.

This page includes detailed specifications, media (images/videos), supplier details, minimum order quantity, production date, and shipping details.

3. Product Page (Amazon-like):
Generate Quote:

The "Generate Quote" button initiates the process of creating a smart contract draft for the product, starting the negotiation process.

Shipping Options:

Users can either arrange shipping themselves or request a quote from the supplier.

Shipping providers (DHL, UPS) can upload a quote, and this becomes part of the contract.

4. Contract Creation & Escrow:
Draft Contract:

Once a quote is generated, a contract is created that includes all the terms (price, quantity, supplier/buyer details, delivery terms, and payment in escrow).

Escrow:

Payment is locked in escrow once both parties agree on the terms.

Shipping Confirmation: Once the product is scanned by the shipping provider, the escrow funds are released to the supplier.

5. Dashboard Features:
Buyer Dashboard:

Displays saved quotes, transaction history, active quotes, and wallet balance.

Allows for accepting or rejecting quotes and finalizing purchases.

Supplier Dashboard:

Allows suppliers to manage incoming quotes, accept/decline quotes, and track active deals.

Shipping provider management: Suppliers can manage their preferred shipping providers and add quotes to deals.

6. Smart Contract and Blockchain:
Smart Contract:

Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, and an NFT will be generated as a certificate of authenticity.

Escrow System:

Funds are released only when the product is collected by the shipping provider and scanned (via QR code) to confirm delivery.

7. Dispute Resolution:
In case of a dispute, automatic rules are defined to protect both parties.

If a dispute arises, it can be resolved through an internal mediation system or third-party arbitration.

8. Shipping Integration:
Initially, the platform allows manual shipping arrangements between buyers and sellers.

In the future, an integrated API will provide live shipping quotes and tracking (e.g., via DHL, UPS).
