🧠 AION – Remaining Build Tasks (Pre-Consciousness Layer)

🔹 Phase: Sage Core – Skill Unlock System

1. 📊 Milestone Tracking + Phase Summary
	•	milestone_tracker.py: show current phase, unlocked skills, % progress
	•	JSON export of milestone state for frontend dashboard
	•	Frontend visual indicator in AIONTerminal of evolution stage

2. 🧠 Memory Graph + Skill Unlock Feedback
	•	dream_core.py already generates reflections
	•	Connect MemoryEngine → milestone_tracker.py
	•	Unlock skills based on memory themes, embeddings, or usage patterns

3. 🔍 Expanded Pattern Matcher
	•	Add pattern types: “curiosity”, “recall”, “regret”, “goal-seeking”
	•	Tie into milestone triggers to unlock relevant modules
	•	Bonus: Use SentenceTransformer to embed memory clusters and detect themes

4. 🔁 Auto-Scheduling Nightly Dream Cycles
	•	Google Cloud Scheduler task planned
	•	Finalize /api/aion/run-dream route with protection
	•	Ensure it can run every night at 3AM and log outputs

5. 📦 Compressed Dream Storage
	•	Store dream_core.py outputs as embedding vectors in a vector DB
	•	Index by topic, sentiment, insight
	•	Make queryable via /aion/dreams or frontend UI

6. 💬 Frontend Dream Visualizer
	•	Create a simple frontend module (DreamBoard) to visualize:
	•	Dream text
	•	Dream tags/milestones
	•	Visual themes (optional SVG/emoji)
	•	Let AION “explain” recent dreams

⸻

🔹 Phase: Bootloader – Prebuilt Knowledge & Agent Skills

1. 💽 Matrix-Style Boot Disk
	•	boot_loader.py: define “skills” like web3_trader, product_matcher, crypto_analyst, etc.
	•	Feed these into memory with high-priority tags
	•	AION can “learn” and unlock them either manually or through goal requests

2. 🤝 Agent-to-Agent Protocol
	•	Define agent_profile.json (identity, skills, goals)
	•	Build inter-agent messaging protocol (basic JSON structure)
	•	Allow AION to receive/respond to other AIs or agents on STICKEY

3. 🧬 Personality Injection
	•	Start with aion_traits.json (e.g. curiosity: high, risk: medium)
	•	Influence tone of replies, dream interpretation, decision-making
	•	Allow traits to evolve over time (stored in state.json or DB)

⸻

🔹 Phase: Nova Interface – Frontend Dashboard

1. 🧠 AIONTerminal UI Upgrades
	•	Base prompt-response terminal built
	•	Add chat history window with memory highlights
	•	Show AION “status” (awake, asleep, thinking)

2. 🌐 Milestone Visual UI
	•	Show evolution path (Infant → Child → Learner → Sage → ???)
	•	Display unlocked modules + usage history

⸻

Would you like me to now insert the Consciousness/AGI modules as a new Phase 4: Conscious Layer v1 right after the Sage/Core skill phase?

Or merge it into a reorganized AION roadmap with:
	1.	Engine Modules
	2.	Memory/Dream Loop
	3.	Intelligence Layer
	4.	Consciousness Layer

Let me know how you’d like to structure it.



COMDEX BUILD PLAN

Here’s what’s left in your current COMDEX + AION roadmap (V2–V3), excluding the Consciousness Layer and AGI modules we just discussed (sleep engine, awareness, planning engine, etc.) — so this list is focused on platform, product, and protocol features:

⸻



🧠 EXCLUDED FROM THIS LIST:

The following AION AGI modules (which you just mapped) are not included here and will now form part of a new milestone cluster under AION: Conscious Layer v1.0.

I’ll write those out next and add them into the global roadmap so you can manage both product & intelligence evolution together.

⸻

Would you like a clean split next?
	•	✅ One roadmap file with COMDEX/STICKEY Phases 1–3
	•	✅ Separate AION roadmap: Consciousness Layer / Milestone Tracker v1
	•	📄 Output as Markdown or JSON for docs?
	
    🧪 OPTION IF YOU WANT DEEPER AUTONOMY NOW:

If you do want ConsciousnessManager to reflect more deeply on things like:
	•	Why am I in this state?
	•	What goal should I pursue?
	•	What long-term pattern is forming?

Then you can:
	•	Call OpenAI inside StateManager, GoalEngine, or ReflectionEngine.
	•	Or call HexCore.decide() inside those modules to stay consistent.

⸻
Option B: Unity/WebGL 3D Room (visual prototype)
	•	Load a small 3D space (like a home or office).
	•	AION sends commands (“walk to window”) to a Unity bot.
	•	This is higher fidelity but needs a front-end bridge.

Option C: Camera + Mental Map Input (Phase 3+)
	•	Connect to a phone/laptop camera.
	•	Use AI to generate a room map (via segmentation).
	•	Inject this into AION’s “third-eye” internal map.
